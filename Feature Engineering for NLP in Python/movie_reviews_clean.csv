this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho babble and quasi religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you re ok it s good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy ,0
some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not a college professor david norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption he pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named adam as it turns out adam doesn t have both oars in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for dr norwell this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another all centered around adam s inabilities and seizures why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out personally i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack bypass this yawner ,0
i ve seen this piece of perfection during the fantasy filmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down i ve seen a lot of films but there are just a few that i d call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight club subconscious cruelty is definitely one of them half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely this is not a movie for normal people with dreams and illusions a person that is living in his her dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film if someone reads this now who has seen s c and also thinks it s great just contact me so far i haven t met anyone who shares my opinion it d be cool this film earns 10 points out of 10 finally i m really sorry for my bad english i m not a studied person und das ist auch gut so g :),1
this movie is likely the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life surpassing the previous most god awful movie spawn of slithis which i saw when i was about 10 bad acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot mishmashed cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects weren t bad but cgi does not a decent movie make i can t believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for hyung rae shim the director please forward it to my user name at gmail and i ll contact him to personally demand a refund ,0
it ll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released still makes me laugh if u enjoy this film try the new hera pheri t is as hilarious and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point and he actually says it out loud u just wanna bash him but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing fantastic film 10 10,1
one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure holywood movies as if those weren t reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about connery s accent or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of the political motivations or any other extra movie concerns simply doesn t love movies see it and be awed by the star power of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film this is proof that hollywood can make em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 8 10 ,1
falsely accused skirt chasing chums john wayne as john scott and eddy chandler as kansas charlie change identities to become alias smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr chandler s is supposed to be rev smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary kornman as anne grown up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you re not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s this movie won t make you one ,0
a beautiful reflection of life s desperation and misdirection of finding love tragic while at the same time absurdly entertaining most people do not give this film a chance ignorance just a mere reflection in itself until next time ,1
i married a japanese woman 14 years ago we re still together however in the 1950 s it would never have been as easy life in the military had been mined for action drama and comedy for years by this point mined to death the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover this is old hat today but then marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort this touched on both possibilities along with the third maybe it is love brando did his usual good job garner did a better job than he usually does he s good but this showed how good he could be umecki chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue she didn t really stretch it was a role that no one who hadn t been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker the real scene stealer was red buttons red was the best thing in this film bank on it and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well a classic ,1
 warning spoilers although it s hard to spoil this film by telling story details eisenstein s black and white propaganda film is not for everyone it s very old and it s er clumsy what makes it great for me is the soundtrack not the original but the updated soundtrack better still the orchestral version prokofiev created my favorite performance is by fritz reiner and the chicago symphony the film is actually funny in places it s reminiscent of the old midsummer night s dream some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent some of the actors are also quite magnificent the actor who played nevsky could have been a superstar today ditto for the warrior chick vasilisa definitely a rocker this may be the world s best collection on film of pithy russian sayings there are tons of them they make up the bulk of the spoken lines the battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high budget hollywood flix these guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be the weapons look nasty so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another the actor playing the german grand marshall is trying really hard to look scary early in the film but he looks like he was really a pussycat after he s captured he looks so pathetic speaks volumes about the intended audience da a really humorous touch is that the german army brings an organ with it played by a character in a black robe watch the russians bring this guy down while he s playing after the battle is over and almost all of the germans are dead comes the best part of the film and the music the song sung to the dead soldiers who ve died defending the motherland this part is so sad it s almost an anti war statement ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film wonder why warning joseph stalin liked this film ironic he killed more russians than anybody those who come to russia carrying a sword will die by the sword ,1
at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece set in the early 60 s complete with a flawless motown soundtrack but there s so much more to this film it gets better every time i see it the cast of unknowns at the time is excellent and it is notable as an all black cast film that doesn t fall into any blaxpoitation clichés at times cooley high almost feels like an updated urban neo realist film with lots of edgy humor added in at times the rather tight budget does show but the constraints actually serve the film well there s a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar minded films like schultz later car wash which was more popular but largely pointless warm hearted but also true to life this might be one of the sleepers of the 70s celebrated at the time it seems that few film freaks know about this one today their loss this is a fine fine film the bare bones pan and scan dvd no widescreen is testament to just how little cared for this excellent film is ,1
this movie i watched back in 1981 when it came out although i missed the first part of the movie what i did see was great this movie is hard to find but if found you must see the acting is great very believable sad movie if i ever find me a copy i definitely will buy me a copy to treasure ,1
mary haines meg ryan a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman eva mendes she doesn t know what to do and friends sylvia fowler annette bening edie cohen debra messing and alex fisher jad pinkett smith try to help ok there was no reason to redo the 1939 movie that s a true classic and doesn t need to be updated and redone naturally it was done this has gotten some of the worst reviews i ve ever seen for a motion picture i love the original and have seen it many times i was constantly comparing it to that now this isn t a classic but it s not that bad minor spoilers first the bad the story is old and was badly updated really a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today meg ryan a wonderful actress is pretty terrible here her face seems unable to change expression i couldn t believe how bad some of her scenes came over eva mendes is bad too but it s not entirely her fault her role is badly written and she has to compete with joan crawford from the original smith s character a tough lesbian goes to pieces in an operating room it is funny but it s showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an emergency also the script inserts some clumsy passages where ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself in those moments it seems more like a lifetime movie than anything else now the good this movie retains the originals decision to never show a man on screen this movie is about and for women men aren t needed btw i m a man bening is just great as fowler whenever she s on screen the movie makes a great leap also smith is just wonderful she doesn t overplay or underplay her lesbian character too much messing is good too but she s not in this much bette midler is just hysterical in a small role and cloris leachman pulls off the nothing role of a housekeeper the direction is good too especially during a fashion show sequence i heard director diane english purportedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full length movie but it doesn t show in the final product also there are some clever references to the original mostly certain lines that were inserted with no fuss i saw this in an audience full of women there were a few guys but not many and they loved it the movie ends on an operating room sequence that had everybody howling so this wasn t needed but it s not the disaster people are saying it is also people are saying we don t need a movie with all women well why not i see plenty of movies with all guys in the cast and no one complains about that ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this with a better performance by ryan i might have given this an 8 or 9 but as it is i can only give it a 7 ,1
passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever you must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one this film for some reason hasn t received its credit due first lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt when a dead father leaves letters behind advising of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a whirlwind adventure mix in a polish translator a comatose mother a crack head with turrets syndrome a twisted homosexual hypnotist and one drag queen money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies my favorite character in this film would have to be the sister crack addict with turret s syndrome her sudden out burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks ,1
gregory peck s brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of corregidor in the philippines at the start of the pacific war largely through to his removal as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war and possibly ever macarthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions he claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace yet he obviously glories in war he consistently denies any political ambitions yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states he shows great respect for other cultures particularly in the philippines and japan and yet is completely out of touch with his own country all these things are held in balance throughout this movie and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and passionately loved his country and especially the army he devoted his life to peck s performance was as i said brilliant to the point actually of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film which is perhaps appropriate given who he was portraying with the possible exception of ed flanders i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur sarcastic repeatedly referring to macarthur as his majesty angry frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply won t respect his authority as president marj dusay was also intriguing as macarhur s wife jean devoted to her husband whom she herself referred to as general although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one i very much enjoyed this movie although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about macarthur s early life i have always chuckled at macarthur s reaction to eisenhower being elected president he ll make a fine president he was the best damn clerk i ever had which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be especially to his military commanders during wartime well worth watching 8 10,1
while movie titles contains the word mother the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother s love for her children however the mother tells a different story the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child here notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother s love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond here he plays darren a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother and sleeping with her daughter as well anne reid who was a familiar face on tv series takes up the challenging role of the leading character may the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband toots in a family visit to her son bobby while she befriends darren a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby s house she was shocked to found out that her daughter paula was sleeping with darren at the same time may was coping with life after the death of toots fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her may starts to find her life going off track until she spends her afternoon with darren darren was nice and friendly to may and may soon finds some affection on darren instead of treating him like a friend she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple later may found sexual pleasure from darren where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series as she do not have much movies in her career resume the mother has put her on the critic s attention daniel craig on the other hand had took on a similar role in his movie career such as sylvia 2003 and enduring love 2004 if his reprising role of james bond fails film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career and the mother is one of them the mother may not be everyone s favorite but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones accompanied by butter and jam ,1
felix in hollywood is a great film the version i viewed was very well restored which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films it has some of hollywood s most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast ,1
i loved this show i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show wasn t the shop located like right on the beach or something i actually wrote back and forth with marci for several years i lost touch and wish i could reconnect now as adults anyone know where she is now i wish they would put it out on dvd i seriously doubt that since i think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place they just don t make shows like this anymore do they i wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age do you guys know anyone that could burn dvd s of the show they taped on vhs i d be willing to pay within reason ,1
master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman s life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interaction while i m not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90 s decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen the movie begins a little slow but finds it s rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and they re not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn t get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at least the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing it s one of the best musical scores ever piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it and deserved to win overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don t don t miss it how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension,1
kusturika made it again another masterpiece a coral comedy full of his own landmarks with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments we laughed and laughed what a party the music is everywhere and also the shooting the animals the crazy bastards sex and amazing gadgets and inventions everything colorfully visual to entertain only pure cinema in essence a wonderful experience to watch and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare and so wonderful well this is one and if you enjoyed kusturica s previous films you ll love this although as in all comedies it is about a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood for it ,1
i must in light of the encomia of praise for this flick from viewers assume once again the role of the turd in the punchbowl as lowell weicker used to say i am scratching my head at the sheer number of laudatory comments the african queen this ain t the period flavor is wonderful yes the acting is fine but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here and i care not how much of it is taken from joyce s text imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people it s not clear to me that it s a family as one person suggested having to listen to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experience of this movie absolutely nothing happens and nothing important is said but it is said at interminable length as i said the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me speaking of mysteries watch a good one rather than this ,0
in 1979 i was a boy of 12 years old my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood as a 12 year old boy this was the first time i saw boobs on television i will never forget the joy of those times racing vans the total ass wipe with the baddest van the water bed the smoking of herbs the hot 70 s chicks the makin love in my chevy van song it was all so new to me a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for i own it and enjoy it about once a year when i watch this movie it makes me want to get my skates with 4 wheels not in a strait line go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair truly great memories of young adolescence ,1
so i got this from the rental store where i work before it was released release is 8 21 just watched it today and now i m speechless they could have had a decent movie here but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways first of all the parts with john krasinski were funny and are the only reason i gave it above a 3 but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible serious reflections on life between the main character andrew keegan and his girlfriend the annoying lacy chabert it would have been much much better as a straight comedy ala lock stock and two smoking barrels i wanted to like it because i think krasinski is funny and want to see him do well the story wasn t bad either just not very original but the directing and a lot of the acting was terrible i swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway their carelessness is showcased when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a dirty harry gun is not a 357 magnum but a 45 it was as everyone knows a 44 magnum so see this if you 1 really like john krasinski 2 like to watch low budget and poorly directed movies or 3 have too much time on your hands this is me ,0
alright i have to admit that i have never seen rhoda and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don t know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian rhoda struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny the script itself was very well put together i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like jonah cecile and everybody else also works well together being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn t hurt either ,1
sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles in this case danish but the watching is worth it as the story progresses the reasoning for the choice of two sisters to take care of their father is questionable but their society is different their choice leaves them alone until a french woman comes there may be a question on why the french woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed the feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from france is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before it provides a fitting thank you for the kindnesses given to the guest filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty it is a beautiful experience for the viewer ,1
i guess if you are into the sci fi and horror stuff it might be interesting the acting was okay but not great the two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty one at the time the plot is okay but the story does jump around a bit leaving one guessing whether you re in boston or pennsylvania the priest seems to use warp speed between the two the catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith what if the two girls had been protestant would the catholics of cared therefore some what contrived who knows some day the catholic church might even learn what the bible teaches if you miss this one don t feel you ve lost anything ,0
final fantasy advent children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game square enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes yes i said incomprehensible did you know that tifa knows blindingly fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second that cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2 ton sword the english dub is mediocre while not egregiously bad it is far from well produced the quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub here is what i d like to say to the die hard ffvii fans who can t stop gushing over this movie advent children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from square enix but even a trashy cg flick like galerians rion had a better story you ll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time the days of its novelty are numbered movies like advent children make me question whether square enix recognizes the potential of its franchises after all and no offense it s a japanese company japanese developers can deliver fun games but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow they are utter psychos however when it comes to production quality advent children features some of the most breathtaking renders in cg history but that doesn t save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters any fan who followed this film knows sephiroth comes back bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake note the one point i give this film is in honor of the 10 000 enslaved japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on cloud s effeminate caucasian head ,0
and not in a fun to watch way it s just bad it s shocking that people have posted positive things about it here the story sucks the acting is bad it s not scary the special effects aren t special oh no the blackboard has hands coming out of it oh gee the mirror turned into water the hair clothes and makeup in the 50s scenes aren t accurate and they got a middle aged man with a receding hairline to play the high school version of himself this is like later on nightmare on elm street stuff i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from ,0
in stand by me vern and teddy discuss who was tougher superman or mighty mouse my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan bruce lee and jet li it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead but it is a fun one and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan in this film he comes across as a martial arts god black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men to be supreme fighting machines their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose they are invincible in some ways now that is the premise for the film but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes jet li is a marvel he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do and that is what makes watching him so fun besides the martial arts in the film black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co star the police officer they are great together but to be honest if anyone is reading this review they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department and the answer to that is a resounding yes lots and lots of gory mindless action you will love this film ,1
certain dvd s possess me until i just have to go out and buy it this was one of those movies like many on here i remember seeing it as a child and loved it i never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut so i was intrigued to see what they might be i will agree that the portabellow road sequence is now a tad long as is the soccer game but other than that i found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place perhaps disney should have had the original version which is the restored version on one side with the restored version on the flip side then people could choose what they wanted to view all in all it s still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories ,1
very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old seeing it more than 30 years later it s still okay but it only mildly held my interest what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing also things that were astonishing to me as a 10 year old came across as just silly for example in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking in fact he doesn t even bother to look and see if they re dead because he knows he hit the mark um yeah right in addition a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden sorry but 35 years later it hasn t really aged that well although it s been a long time since i ve seen that one as well probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody ,0
for what it is this is a pretty good movie i like both johns stamos full house stockwell christine top gun they both give strong performances the love interest is ok but this is more of a guy s movie than a good date movie i love harleys and i hated seeing them paint over the 14 coats of hand rubbed lacquer with good old army olive drab there is a small history lesson here in that harley davidson motorcycles played a key role in wwii i don t know if the training was quite like this bunches the movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere with good riding action sequences i love looking at the demographics of the vote history one 18 year old man gave the movie a 10 true bike lover i guess i wouldn t give it a 10 but i did give it an 8 i do not weigh every movie with the same scale there are movies that were big budget with great actors that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big star wars episode i is my best example i loved the first three sw movies but i thought episode i was weak in comparison so it gets a lower rating from me than this movie i expect more from george lucas ,1
let s get things straight i was raised catholic and in a very religious family and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home that was useful for two things to make a convinced atheist out of me and to give me deep insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas and i say if a catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the killer he can report it to the police even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards he can not reveal what he s told in confession but he can talk about anything he sees outside that and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut so here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie and another lie is there s no absolution for murder according to the catholic church there s absolution for any sin as long as there s sincere repentance so far the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller as people frequently say this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niro s weakest performances in the untouchables and bates features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past but above that i think the film would have been much better had real life ulster native liam neeson back then mostly unknown to big audiences played mickey rourke s part not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters but he d make us believe the character as real something rourke just can t back in the 80s rourke was not a bad actor afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks but he was one of those performers like brad dourif who s as good as the director he works with and as a former ira terrorist rourke s acting comes across more like a pimp sad to think that had this movie been made just some three to six years later when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimi s enjoyable darkman and superstardom in 1993 with schindler s list while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has been liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of docherty but just can t carry this movie along as the lead yet another missed opportunity and yet another film with the potential of being a classic that became instantly forgettable fare ironically enough the often criticized score by underrated composer bill conti worked for me i didn t find it overly melodramatic but suitably gritty and beautiful it reminded me of howard shore s score for the silence of the lambs here s to mike hodges talent who made get carter yes but don t forget he s the mastermind behind flash gordon as well it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room it shows as some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just don t glue and a director s cut is waiting to see the light ok but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie as we ll still have the bad casting and the false premise there 4 10 ,0
as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is overpopulation means there s too many people to feed i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies stalin s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s and let s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth hong kong and macau have never suffered a famine in modern times likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn t strictly down to overpopulation it s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside it s a symptom of industrial progress not of too many births so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughablebut don t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the70s it plays on the contempary audience s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit brandy and fresh meat thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line if i could afford it i d smoke two maybe three of these a day but it s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals flowers running water and snow covered mountains a world thorn s generation has never known this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth,1
on the scale of 1 to 10 i gave this a 4 i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to like on an erotic scale i give this a 6 many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness i always enjoy nudity and nancy travis and faye grant come through but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic ,0
my daughter liked it but i was aghast that a character in this movie smokes as if it isn t awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more considerate i wonder was that intentional did big tobacco sponsor the film what does it take to ban smoking from films at least films intended for children and adolescents my daughter liked it but i was aghast that a character in this movie smokes as if it isn t awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more considerate i wonder was that intentional did big tobacco sponsor the film what does it take to ban smoking from films at least films intended for children and adolescents ,0
waldemar daninsky paul naschy travels to tibet and is bitten by a yeti which causes him to become a werewolf he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover and is later revived by a female scientist dr ilona ermann who uses him in mind control experiments daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor s failed experiments upon hearing of naschy s death from colleague jon kitley i rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch in my scramble i found i own not one but three copies of fury of the wolfman the film is of questionable video quality the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times and the american versions have two love scenes removed quite frankly without a remastered uncut copy i wasn t really getting the proper movie in all its glory this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count waldemar daninsky i suspect this is true but you wouldn t know this from the film itself the plot is confusing at times and there s really no indication that this is a sequel if you read the plot summaries on wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box you ll see that i m not alone in my confusion perhaps the film s shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through while floating around for years it was only released in 1973 due to problems involved in finding a distributor and naschy said in his autobiography that the director zabalza was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him those really aren t light accusations and i have no idea what zabalza had to say on his own behalf chances are sooner or later you ll come across a low grade version of fury of the wolfman it appears in a variety of three packs and box sets so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know what really needs to happen is an american uncut version with a decent sound and video mix and the love scenes thrown back in as far as i know this does not exist let us honor paul naschy s legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves ,0
dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated unfulfilled in her current marriage kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger they go back to his apartment for casual sex when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape detective marino dennis franz says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate s son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer clear liz s name see that justice is done written directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery the script is measured slow at times but it likes to focus on the character s so you really know them the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off then the film switches it s attentions to liz no one else gets a look in this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging unfortunately the character s themselves aren t exactly likable i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you d have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill it s a good film but it didn t excite me that much i didn t really find any character to root for or like the film tacks on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didn t really see the point of director de palma directs with style visual flair from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole it s impeccably filmed throughout i d imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though nothing about it really excited me that much there is a fair bit of nudity some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence kate s murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight if that s the right word however it s by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe with a supposed budget of about 6 500 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film the new york locations are nice the cinematography is good as a whole it s extremely well made i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud intrusive the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn t think caine had that much screen time allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them this blow out 1981 he cast her as a prostitute a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn t think it quite lived up to it s lofty reputation good but not brilliant ,1
i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible i d recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under laying meaning of the movie and plot ,1
scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning the good actor being tim curry the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist the plot to scary movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it ,0
steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy he absolutely does not fit this part like the woeful remake of the out of towners this movie falls flat on it s face how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmon s wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people s classic work it s a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over the line the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh if you want to see the real bilko get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho none of them should ever have happened ,0
in short this movie was awful i understand it s a disney movie which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting however i must say this is the worst of all disney movies with bad acting lots of irritating shrieking teen girls my god and an extremely unrealistic plot even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie the only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching this no matter how bored you are on a sunday afternoon ,0
stardust another guarded review originally written june 15 2007 the marketing machine has only just begun for this one no site yet wth so i doubt most of you have heard about it in truth i hadn t either sort of when i got the posting i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 as a mere mortal movie goer turns out it wasn t transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as that neil gaiman movie what is it about well in short it s a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star any more than that and i d be giving away plot info which is a a breach of contract and b spoiling your fun if you really want to know what it s about go buy the book rumour has it gaiman might be something of a writer not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile and for this one it certainly was this screening was special in that it included not just film critics but also exhibitors they rarely have a mixed screening and local sci fi fantasy folks so you know the expected audience right i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expect oh how sweetly wrong i was yes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom but it was not lord of rings it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe ahem eragon it was much more intimate than all that but like lord of the rings it was the well humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities it s surely a romantic tale but with generous splashes of humour and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism it s more along the lines of dramedy than comedy before i go on let s do this movie review thing acting is in the very least good it s always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles michelle pfieffer is not sadly one of those she plays a villain and she does the job nothing special rupert everett though he was a real jerk that is a great villain peter o toole is well peter frickin o toole which is marvelous ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did and charlie cox who as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain t never heard of claire danes claire danes claire danes i ve always been of mixed opinion with her she can be great and then she can seem to miss the mark in this she s the former and she is quite literally the star of this film sure her accent stumbles here and there and yes she s not as good as she can be when cox isn t in the scene however well see for yourself special effects are muted yet accomplished and only significant where they should be best flying ship yet sorry potter direction is light hearted and flows nicely cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand all else is top bracket and now that that s done the writing oh the writing neil you devil it s hard in today s climate to do anything original and at first you begin to wonder a kingdom a dying king a boy out to prove his own worth witches ghosts a quest or three what s new but gaiman s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart and though you suspect how it s all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and if you re me find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best in the end you ll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not fantastical and real i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i won t ruin it for you for those who read the book rest assured it s done properly those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new withheld for this generation the blank gets filled in only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it you ll know when you walk out anyway i sincerely hope stardust doesn t get lost among the tentpoles even if it does it ll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know forgot to add the withheld reveal i m a few years late but a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new the princess bride for this generation perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i m still confident that years form now there will be the same oh i love that movie response to this as there is now for the princess bride ,1
i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia the movie never really gets through to the person his thoughts and feelings what they did was to collect the little material that they had shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say oh he was such an inspiration to all of us like bono or johnny depp whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart that ever lived sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him sure being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60 90 minutes go see the movie if you are a fan otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound ,0
love trap is a must see independent film when i sat down to watch the movie i came in with low expectations but left with a blessing the story is poetic substantive and creative the writer pulls you in further and further which each scene allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with the movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what i consider love to be the movie displayed what love really is action not emotion i was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie the entire presentation surpassed my expectations i give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds ,1
i was one of the few non liberals who showed up to see steve s video it was quite an experience in propaganda film making and boredom i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore s visit to my local school uvsc but it turned out to be another liberal slash and burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community it sure seems self serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues what s more surprising is to see all the 10 votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video golly gee batman this must rank with all the president s men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film yeah like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out ,0
there s only one thing i m going to say about cat in the hat as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren t exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i m not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying don t see it it belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so unkiddy it s funny,0
very bad very very bad as a fellow who aspires to make be in or at least sniff the catering table at a movie set i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made however this movie oh dear realizing frightworld doesn t aspire to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake and to be fair it is more entertaining than say red zone cuba but not by much so i won t try to critique just let me ask throw out some observations 1 if gore is the point of the movie shouldn t you be able to see it 2 if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment 3 in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll difficult i know but really 4 there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo rochester area most you can hire really cheap get one who knows how to frame a scene 5 just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn t mean he should do so every two seconds 6 kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls who s tops we want to see taken off 7 editing should help tell the story or set a mood at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary it s sloppy some good things not all the acting was bad jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back there was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid poptart is a name that deserves a better movie i like the moxie of frightworld too next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis upgrade at least ed wood ,0
just watched it on the hallmark channel i was surprised to john denver this movie was full of clichés but that is to be expected a made for tv christmas movie come on the acting is as good as any other 80 s made for tv movie the story is as i said before predictable and cliché but still good if you are looking for a campy christmas movie it will certainly scratch your itch i was also pleased when i learned that it took place in georgetown colorado it is a real mountain town west of denver very cool as this is my home region i was never a big john denver fan i always found him to be pretty foney but he was a decent actor he is very good as the good old boy like he played in this film if you get the chance to watch it than do i m sure it will be on again in 2007 ,1
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada lee and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen james wong howe this remake is abominable in spite of the presence of rod steiger joe mantegna and jennifer beals there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original only the main character s name charlie davis is the same in both films i don t think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake i am amazed that rod steiger participated this may be the only bad film he ever made maybe he needed the paycheck ,0
human pot roast joe don baker mitchell stars in this dull unremarkable action movie as deputy geronimo a fat gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit listening to country music and eating too many donuts meanwhile a vaguely criminal guy named palermo played by the guy who owned the drill in fulci s gates of hell stumbles into joe don s territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene joe don slowly gives chase and offs palermo s brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase it s your move think you can take me well go ahead on for some reason joe don a texas lawman must transport palermo to italy mr palermo s been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government says mr wilson another vague character played by bill mckinney who was in master ninja 1 she freak and a lot of good clint eastwood movies anyhoo joe don s plane must land on the island of malta where palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like jon lovitz and that s where the movie grinds to a halt for the rest of the movie joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more then joe don keeps looking for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more then joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more this is one aggravating movie at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea all the other characters wonder if he s dead or not finally concluding that he is but then he shows up he was rescued by a poor family and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days even his cute julia louise dreyfuss esque sidekick doesn t welcome him back she does however offer to help him find palermo so joe don looks for palermo looses palermo ends up in a jail cell is yelled at by the malta chief of police and then let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more highpoints include a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats some sexy strippers a shoot out involving a kid dressed like napoleon and a cart of tomatoes a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk and any scene without joe don lowpoints include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger it should be noted that this is from greydon clark director of angel s revenge who appears as the sheriff ick ,0
this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen the stark scenery the isolation the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication the acting is completely natural but for me as a foodie the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette s menu and choice of wines are authentic and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it,1
i rented this movie the other day b c i love romance stories but this has got to be the worst one i have ever seen in my life i find it hard to believe that sam would fall in love with kelley after they ve said hardly no more than 2 words to each other when she has a great long time boyfriend who s devoted to her completely i thought kelley was a major jerk throughout the movie and he never changed at all the only good thing about the movie was josh hartnett i thought he did a wonderful acting job and i m going to start watching more movies of his ,0
i first watched kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many 80 s horror titles in their original boxed form that have been deleted for some time i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didn t like back then i now own and have now re watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a s a p hurray for the 80 s and long live horror ,0
good animation nice character design and a light hearted story make suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu enjoyable to watch after my first viewing i thought that this anime was pretty good but but was much better on for a second watch this is because it is done out of chronological order and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn t see before or it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn t notice before you may want to read the original novels not manga by tanigawa nagaru before after seeing this the anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows however there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are referenced to bamboo w wishes attached shown in episode 14 overall this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot reading the book improves upon it as well it is a nice break from the shounen jump anime that seem to be taking over ,1
my first opinions on this movie were of course bad i was expecting a horrible crappy acting bad entertainment ridiculous special effects movie what i got was actually not that bad the special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent the acting wasn t that bad and overall i had fun watching this movie it s still a pretty bad film but it s not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be and i m pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me even when it wasn t that good overall it s a film that should be avoided but to me it wasn t as bad as i was expecting it to be ,0
when the italians and miles o keeffe work together nothing can go wrong as ever miles is great as the almost as great ator the most lovable barbarian of all times totally lives up to the first movie ,1
some of the best movies that are categorized as comedies actually blur between comedy and drama the graduate and butch cassidy and the sundance kid which were made also in the late 1960 s are perfect examples are they comedies with dramatic undertones or dramas with a lot of humor in many respects the odd couple falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing despite the rather light hearted tv show of the 1970 s the original odd couple is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation it s really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage neatness the characteristic of felix ungar jack lemon perfectly cast and messiness the characteristic of oscar madison walter matthau are only the beginning and somewhat superficial as the story unfolds we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness briefly the story is really about felix ungar who has to face an impending divorce from his wife francis who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story on the verge of suicide ungar goes to the only place he knows the apartment of oscar madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often we learn that ungar is not only a member of this poker club but the group knows what s happening to him and try in their inept way to help out madison figures the best way to help ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off unfortunately for madison he doesn t know what he s getting himself into madison is a carefree happy go lucky if rather irresponsible slob who s refrigerator was last cleaned probably when herbert hoover was still in the white house madison s idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table on the other hand he enjoys booze and women in short having a good time ungar is not only altogether different he is diametrically opposite he is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating at one point he calls his ex wife not to talk about reconciling but to get her recipe for meatloaf at another moment ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw when madison seems unimpressed ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can t stand coleslaw who is this guy but he has another endearing trait felix is also a hypochondriac he obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he s helping his sinuses he seems to have every health condition in the book and if they made up more felix would probably have them ultimately he is overly self absorbed running throughout the movie are references to marriage at one point when madison is trying to convince ungar to move in he says what do you want a wedding ring but little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can t deal with the messy guy but the other way around their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship and the climax occurs when oscar invites two lonely british sisters for a get together with both comedic and tragic results this is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed with superlative performances by walter matthau and jack lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else it is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today ,1
this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w sarno it features plenty of soft core sex really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well made marie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie it s a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies a must see for fans of sexploitation ,1
this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom hanks at his finest tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this film he comes off in this film as a bit gritty but still emerges smelling like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks character shoots and kills all of the men in mr rooney s group there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion i love the look on john rooney paul newman s character s face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is tom hanks s character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me ,1
an unfunny unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to peter sellers career it is a pity this movie was ever made ,0
on the 28th of december 1895 in the grand café in paris film history was writing itself while louis lumière showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience la sortie des usines lumière was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience we start with closed doors of the lumière factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close again whether this is the first film or not some say l arrivée d un train à la ciotat was the first film lumière recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you don t get to see historical things like this every day ,1
while on vacation on northern australia gracie diana glenn her husband adam andy rodoreda and her younger sister lee maeve dermody decide to take the blackwater barry tour in the swamp for fishing their guide jim ben oxenbould uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot when they stop they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills jim the three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location however in the muddy water their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water black water is a tense realistic and dramatic low budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning based on a true event the acting of the unknown diana glenn maeve dermody and andy rodoreda is top notch giving credibility to this simple but scary story there are many similarities between this movie and prey but in different environments my vote is seven title brazil medo profundo deep fear ,1
dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie i ve ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie aren t writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever ,1
that s pretty ridiculous i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u s u k and all over the world the religion has over a billion followers i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media i wonder why also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion its a religion of one billion people and these are less than one percent i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge personal or business matters through their so called religion,0
i was blown away by this film i m one of those people who just takes a risk with movies that don t especially appeal to me sometimes and i ve got to say this one paid off i mean wow even my young boys enjoyed the film 5 and 6 at the time though i m quite certain this was not geared to their age groups this movie was clean too which is a great plus it is so great to sit down to a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity violence except one very brief scene or anything else one is likely to find morally objectionable this movie brought you along on a journey you are so ready to believe because of the great acting you feel the vast range of emotions portrayed along with the characters i never thought a golf movie would have me at the edge of my seat but i couldn t help being intensely interested in how this one would turn out i have nothing to compare it to since i have neither watched golf in reality or on film before but everyone did a great job in keeping the pace and emotions captivating here the score also did wonders excellent excellent score even if you don t think this would be your kind of film watch it you may be pleasantly surprised i certainly was ,1

first i d like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 what i know is this star wars all the movies less so with episode 2 though captured something magical it s hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works star wars is more than a movie it s an idea how may you ask i shall explain star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand episode vi does the very well concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the prequels reveals even more to the hinted back story suddenly it s darth vader at the front and viewers realize that it s the story about anakin not just luke but even before 1 3 there was amazing depth to it all it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas s lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far away star wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small i feel as though i ve been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope ,1
oh god what an idiotic movie incredibly cheap with fake special effects the creature is played by one guy in lame costume and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ha ha ha they re simply ludicrous for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more all in all this is a great entertainment if you re drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk i don t think so ,0
i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie but i had no idea what i was getting myself into i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture i finally know what hell is like it s this movie for eternity this movie has no value it didn t even really have a plot there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie don t even watch it not even to see how bad it is i beg you if you watch it then it means they win ,0
don t quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldn t have been much comedy i also don t think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesn t change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic i d say but happy it s a light hearted movie with a feel good ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and i m glad they didn t show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly ,1
poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure you re in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life ,1
this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radio s baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however 7 1 2 decades later it s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts as for the stooges this is a film from there very early days before mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on him you ll see what i mean and the rest is history within a year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didn t act as a team they just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the piano this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome as for durante i never knew what the public saw in him as least as far as his films are concerned he was loud and loud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton s career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat in this film the stooges they didn t yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in a role you d certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as a whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called pre code scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title it s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything it s quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the 63 minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades see the film you ll see that i mean ,0
yet again i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of criticizing japanese films made before 1970 fires on the plain 1959 is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason as much as i love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film it s still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of masterpiece what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box movie making orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting acting camera work etc yet it always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards for example one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the plain uses this indolent tactic to the extreme after a funny head slap the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer why can t you grasp the situation we landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at tacloban we lost two thirds of our men our artillery was sunk in transit we tried to reach burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible the enemy s counterattack forced a fanout across the valley you know that so why exactly is one character telling another character something he already knows oh yeah that s right the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events heck even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here such instances of poor quality movie making are littered throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles for example the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in japanese garb instead of doing the natural thing like oh i don t know giving a depressed mannerism the character blurts out japanese soldiers thanks buddy but i could have figured that one out for myself even worse this movie is saturated with over dramatic ploys the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly useless but it turns out that the soldier s boots are in even worse condition so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his super worn boots behind fine i get the point the soldiers are in rough shape a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let it go until the second soldier arrives you see he finds the previous soldier s super worn boots and notices get ready cause here it comes that his boots are super duper worn boots lucky man he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his super duper worn boots behind but you see that s not all because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super duper worn boots and inspects them along with his own super duper worn boots since both pairs suck he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot at this point i was ready to throw my television through my living room window the heavy handedness overdramaticism and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film making it s super duper bad film making there are a number of similar completely stupid moments to be had like the time when the lead character asks someone hey are you dead like the guy is going to answer yes if he actually kicked the bucket i ll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction i laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid goofy expression on his face the fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an imdb average rating of 8 4 while a certifiable masterpiece like a tale of two sisters 2003 only gets a 7 5 is the height of mass stupidity and to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that atots doesn t make sense well not every movie can have completely outrageous super duper worn boots on its side ,0
i really liked the movie the emporer s new groove but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having relations with a llama seriously this movie was bad it s like club dread after super troopers i am supposed to write 10 lines but i don t even know what else to say i laughed a couple of times but only because i was drinking a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk it was not maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people aren t either way just stick with the emporer s new groove if you want a funny cartoon llama themed movie line 10 is this line right here ,0
i thoroughly enjoyed a man called horse when it was released in 1970 but return played like a typical sequel everything about it budget script plot casting and acting was inferior to the original gale sondergaard as elk woman an elder of the yellow hand tribe looks nothing like an indian and neither do half of the other indians who were played by italians mexicans and latinos with cheap wigs and the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors he even used the bow like a woman finally richard harris who did such a superb job in the original seems to be coasting this time around i guess he couldn t resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as horse to be fair there are some interesting moments in the movie such as horse s undergoing a painful purification ritual to find his vision and rally the yellow hands against their indian enemies and white oppressors but on the whole return is uneven boring corny and predictable just like most sequels ,0
the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity however for most of us this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here the movie fixated on breasts which soon became boring and i lost interest if this was on tv i would ve switched to the latest news on the starr report that s how boring i found this movie ,0
until i saw this film life is beautiful was my favourite film of all time this film is everything a great film should be great script unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands this film contains the taste that could not come from hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from france a wonderful movie even above the calibre i have come to expect when i see the handmade films logo come up i need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet ,1
one of the major successes to the decline of western civilization filmmaker penelope spheeris indie breakthrough is that it can perhaps appeal to non punk fans as to the hardcore ones more importantly it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely market worthy when bands would play or at the least try to play in some cases in dank dirty clubs to an audience that had as much self respect as they had respect for the bands for the fan such as myself there are precious interviews with some of the quasi legends of la s punk scum some dead some still living and still hard working in the scene performances and interviews include the likes of the circle jerks x black flag in the pre henry rollins days catholic discipline fear the alice bag band and most memorable in my opinion being the germs while i knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film the jerks and black flag mostly i had only heard rumors about lead singer the late darby crash and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the if not the epitomes of the punk movement he doesn t take himself too seriously he loves to drink sometimes when he speaks it s complete gibberish and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free form way exhilarating a performer like that would probably scare steve miller and jackson browne out of their skins decline of western civilization may not turn on every non punk fan that seeks this film out it s hard to find on video but it shouldn t necessarily turn them off either like a kind of anthropologist that s sneaked into the party spheeris gets the behavior of these people down pat their motives their likes and hatreds and the power that was their on and off screen personas a few of them almost come off as normal some don t but they re only offensive to those who aren t too open to things on top of that the film is a must see to the kinds of kids that think they re punk fans just because they listen to good charlotte and blink 182 if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love give the pioneers a chance a,1
i don t think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions i tolerated the first season unfortunately this is a show about lawyers who aren t really lawyers god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show it just made me gag a bit that aside spader and shatner who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most annoying while this might be a compliment in some situations it s certainly not here their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first but since that s what they re doing literally all the time i ve realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get trying to intersperse some serious dramatic and even tear jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest i ve been experiencing trying to enjoy the show alan shore s flamboyant and gratuitous public service announcements where he spouts off his opinions do not impress denny crane is just annoying i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for crane s speech wearing a colonial outfit i m giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show s attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care i think the show s writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start the thing is i don t care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more i m not a teenager anymore and i think this show is promising if its goal wasn t to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings of course i m writing this after i realized that it s really not gonna get much better than this it s a shame because it s one of those shows i d love to love ,0
dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget i was really looking forward to it and i really wanted it to be good but it is not the only good thing are the special effects that are very well done but like in a really bad hollywood blockbuster everything else is missing it is poorly written the screenplay tries to fulfill genre rules with standard suspense love story elements but there is no depth or originality at all it s way below average the next thing it is also poorly directed it has this uninteresting tv directing style with lots of close ups and wanna be great action by fast editing where actually no action or suspense is the actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any way i don t know they obviously try to do a typical tv movie and not a film for the cinema where its alway good to have some edges and a clear visual style but why do they try to fulfill typical commercial hollywood rules it really feels like the screenwriter did a weekend class with some american scriptwriting guru and then delivered this mess is there no producer who is responsible for the project who has an interest in dramaturgy visual style or plain in simple this magical cinematic moments that make some tv movies great do they think that an tv audience is stupid and doesn t need to get a high quality movie experience the downfall was a very good example for a good tv movie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing don t waste you time with this one rent downfall instead ,0
at first i was convinced that this was a made for tv movie that wasn t worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumb struck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the over the top stunts and c movie acting this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn t laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a less funny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with even worse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and high fives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier ,0
i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about 10 it was on right after bay city rollers i saw it come on to family channel one day and taped it for my then three year old daughter i d forgotten all the things i d loved as a child the magic flute the zoom broom witcheepoo s makeup this show is decidedly low tech the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes but kids love this stuff they would way way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high tech computer animation there is mild slapstick but no adult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept jimmy s schemes kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it she used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and it s still one of her favourites i see that a new pufnstuf 2000 is in the works i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don t do anything like computer animating characters etc i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf ,1
if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a syndicated children s show right this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as pokemon pepper ann mighty morphin power rangers and vr troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment don t worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and c o p s a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called the disney afternoon aside from a dumbed down show called the gummi bears early shows like darkwing duck duck tales and chip n dale s rescue rangers gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the rescuers down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines talespin the premiere of plunder and lightning was a two hour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters there s rebecca cunningham an independent female but still fallible kit cloudkicker full of pre teen angst and optimism louie with his loyalty and support frank wildcat the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don t have and of course in the middle of it all there s baloo whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond this is because whenever there s trouble baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker than most fastest of all sea duck read james bond s aston martin of course every great show has to have great villains and talespin doesn t disappoint here either from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage to the hilarious and inept soviet satirized thembrians the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that children s programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family ,1
i don t see the point it s ponderous the animated people are creepy look up uncanny valley scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose the plot is skeletal and must be padded out with lots of meaningless dramatic screaming roller coaster rides as if disney or spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the movie most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene they don t they just vanish with no lasting impact somebody summed it up as if you don t believe in santa claus you ll be kidnapped on a train on christmas eve that pretty much sums it up ,0
a young basketball playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging he s pressured into concluding his research because he hasn t published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him i think he does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies he then tries it on himself he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy she s the one who had been demanding results from the research initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength he then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else you won t believe your eyes either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he s turned into incredibly there s a further change in store the end of the movie is really really absurd about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it but she has a very small part i d once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main character s eyes occasionally turn green in the movie the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed the novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie i m definitely getting rid of it ,0
so wynorski remakes curse of the komodo a second time this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists anti capitalists and he adds a cobra most of the movie is spent listening to the self righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there dna experiments were conducted critters started to grow people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks etc needless to say it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious do gooders lest i forget there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier than thou posse gets picked off one by one but they probably comprise less than 2 of the film the main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest dino crisis video game the acting is pretty bad overall even for this sort of film half the actors seem like they re more concerned with pronouncing every last syllable of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable manner i actually did make it through to the end but it s one of those movies i wish i would have recorded and then watched later because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast forwarded through overall i give this effort one star it has absolutely none of the elements that make a b movie fun to watch it s a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching boa vs python ,0
as a fan of wm faulkner since college i was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons my grandfather also named clarence brown as was the director grew up in the oxford area having been born near there in 1888 we attended a week long family reunion at oxford in july 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of ole miss my recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but i was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white i was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and i would love to know more about that story now days oxford is a larger more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and i hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years juano hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen other faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare one of the best was a pbs treatment of the barn burner from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that faulkner wrote so incisively about so often ,1
wtf do any of his books movies end in a happy ending the notebook was good but sheesh enough with the depressing endings already i m told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life understandable but sometimes it s nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days don t we already know what really happens in real life can t we for one moment an hour and a half live vicariously through a movie that ends on a happy note that gives us hope for our own futures yeah wah i know but for real i think we need to preface movies that end like this one with a warning beware no happy ending ,1
i ll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies they are too numerous to name a much shorter list would be what they got right 1 dude named noah 2 ark with animals on it if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noah s ark and the destruction of sodom go rent the bible 1966 it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac it s a much better movie and it may be that the abomination called noah s ark 1999 drove you to seek just such a film http www imdb com title tt0060164 i really couldn t stomach watching the whole movie from reading other comments i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate as a christian it was intolerable to me possibly the worst movie ever made no real point to this movie either except maybe to showcase their sub par computer animation was it a complete waste maybe not god can use evil to work good romans 8 28 says 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose genesis 50 says 20 but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive in the second example joseph s brothers meant to kill him but god turned their evil into a very great good he may have done the same thing with this movie people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves to find out about lot and sodom they would have to go the whole way up to genesis 19 before god destroys sodom and gomorrah by then they have read almost half of genesis so they might want to finish the next book is exodus which the movie the ten commandments was based on and much more accurately if they have seen that movie then exodus becomes an easy read so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah s ark i m sure this actually happened to someone out there god works in mysterious ways ,0
this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important point the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it s the government s duty to provide them with work whereas in the u s we know we have to go out there and create value for someone spain never looked so backward ,0
i bought the dvd out of a big bin for 4 99 thinking i d lucked into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the karakoram mountains and k2 in particular fast forwarding through the film i reached the climactic scene in which the climbers catch their first sight of mount waddington towering to all of 13 260 ft in canada s coastal range at least one of the several bozos geared up to climb k2 clearly has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like he has to be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he wouldn t have been brought by said partner to an ugly mountain given that one of the film s premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on k2 you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale while good enough for the likes of reinhold messner are beneath him to be honest i haven t watched the whole thing what i ve seen makes me cringe they say that you get what you pay for at 4 99 i ve been ripped off ,0
grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget ,1
i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot serpent s kiss reigne margot redford s cast is perfect tom skerritt is the rev maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redford s directorial hands given the material redford s ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again ,1
this is a movie about a man everybody thinks is jewish this is a movie about lawrence newman who lives in brooklyn in the 1940 s at the time of wwii one day when he gets himself glasses people start thinking he s a jew and that only because he looks like one and he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood so some people start treating him like dirt they make that judgment being a jew of larry s fresh wife gertrude hart too that makes their lives unbearable neal slavin s focus 2001 is a fairly good look at the antisemitism that s a problem that won t go away the movie is based on athur miller s novel which i admit i haven t read but the movie is really good so i m sure the book would also the actors do good job william h macy is always good and his work as larry newman is brilliant laura dern is gert hart and she s magnificent meat loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep jews out by any means necessary david paymer s character as the jewish shop owner mr finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie paymer is the perfect choice for the role one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr finkelstein and newman fight against those nazi like people with baseball bats they join together to fight the evil the christian and the jew ,1
this movie is excellent not because it does anything special or new but because it is consistently great in all of its parts no part stands out as being ground breaking or stellar but all parts are far above mediocre and that makes to me an excellent movie i own several copies of this movie and may acquire it on collectors dvd or blu ray someday holding off right now due to high blu ray prices and of course the face that i don t have a blu ray player but that s beside the point of this review it stars off sort of ordinary but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension some action strongly portrayed characters and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end wait no it does not start out ordinary it starts out sort of like what a qun tar movie wishes it could be with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes very very wrong by the end of the movie nothing was as it seemed and a few people are dead and a few people are very rich i won t tell you who watch and enjoy overall rating 10 10 a excellent ,1

this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today s more hectic and loud films it is another solid based on a true store which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes frankly i don t know but i liked the story the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else including his father does in this west virginia town the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father which i think was overdone i would like to have a little less tension between the two the young man still a boy is played by jake gyllenhaal one of his first staring assignments i think he s likable as are his school buddies in here it s nice to see nice kids in a modern day film the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper the dad and laura dern the kid s teacher who encourages him all the time the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear once again i wish there more of these kind of films made today ,1
rumor has it that when the nasa technical advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours after all unless you are a politician or work crew the shuttle you are not going to get in the shuttle furthermore space cadet camp is in alabama not florida the truth is everyone on earth will win multi billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible this film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to ksc ccafs this is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop ,0
this film is one of the best memories i have from childhood having always loved tigers my mum took me to see it it is absolutely amazing its is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you the image of tigers running through the snow with it all spraying around is still in my head some 25 yrs on not many films have managed that as other comments have said photography is stunning a must see i have also been looking for the film for some time with no luck at all checking amazon every now and then reveals nothing not even listed if anyone does know of a source please contact me or post here tim:(,1
killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly i m not all that surprised that more people haven t seen this movie the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didn t this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that goddamn clown i hate him i hate him so much and i don t hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable the last thing we need is a killjoy 3 ,0
i just finished watching this film for me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes i feel that this is the best score i ve come across the mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well ,1
why is it that virtual x rated video game women can speak through their mouths but virtual fighting game champion dante has to use a combination of telepathy and over dramatic facial expressions i feel that either they needed to cast someone who looked more villain like michael bermardo s big brown doe eyes don t exactly strike fear in the hearts of well anyone except for maybe casting directors who consistently cast him as either a villain or a heroic bad boy or they needed to just let him use his real voice and move his mouth and maybe give him a costume that would not make him stick out like a sore thumb when walking down the street but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm ,0
 voodoo academy features an academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously the sole administrator of this academy is a young and seductive headmistress and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash so to speak sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie if you re not interested in the male form stay away burdened by weak and awkward dialogue this low budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns the mood is claustrophobic with tediously long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days ,0
first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials aren t actually part of a movie perhaps though it should ve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but i m not so sure that s a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didn t need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints the actress who played viv vance not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she s a whole new person that wasn t too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn t necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucy s entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they weren t so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucy s life really neat and it s too bad that wasn t explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i don t think i ll ever watch this again and i don t think this movie ll be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isn t an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b,1
even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it s still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke first off jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor man s gerard depardieu naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that the poor man s box office poison really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the 4th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisie what am i saying it isn t let s just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasn t sharp enough satire is a tricky thing if it isn t sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead i think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel film very sharp satire potential spoiler alert really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbé s character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control though i m guessing he didn t cast jeroen krabbé because he s the worst actor and every character he s played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except he s incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well i just don t see it so you understand the dilemma i m faced with here right it is the worst film ever because he s supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the 4th man s deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhoven s reputation as a good director etc etc ,0
the plot is about a female nurse named anna is caught in the middle of a world wide chaos as flesh eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer so far so good i usually enjoy horror movies but this piece of film doesn t deserve to be called horror it s not even thrilling just ridiculous even the flintstones or kukla fran and ollie will give you more excitement it s like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor the heroes who has locked themselves in inside the shopping mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside are not better either even though they doesn t seem to be drunk they give the impression of being mentally disabled save your money instead of spending it on this ,0
i am a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of info on serial killers obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating because half of the movie was fictional more than that the character of ed gein was portrayed in the wrong light i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend erica i rented it to watch ed gein and his legendary story this movie was awful the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasn t too bad acting horrible actors sub par movie waste of time a big upset all around but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie ,0
the next karate kid in my opinion is an excellent martial arts flick i thought that eric chris conrad and julie hilary swank looked good in their prom attire to me ned michael cavalieri was a real bully this was because he got julie in trouble with principal wilkes eugene boles if you ask me colonel dugan michael ironside was a pure a this was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn t tolerate mistakes my favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between julie and the alpha elite in conclusion i highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial arts flicks or are fans of hilary swank ,1
i have to admit i have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of british movies though not all of course succeed this film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face its about character development and relationships truth and lies and whether love is sometimes simply not enough some very nicely understated acting from all the participants especially the two leads tom wilkinson and emily watson there was a lot of fuss made about gosford park but with this piece i feel fellowes has actually produced a better movie though it has not been a mainstream release an intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness ,1
silly hilarious tragic sad inevitable a group of down and outs team up with a seasoned crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty great idea if you ignore the screwup factor nice to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change the casting is perfect and the acting standards very high although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn t new i think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before very well done guys ,1
i tend to fall in and out of love with anime as the more you watch the more you notice a lot of shows are just poor copies of the few gems or rehashes of old formulas but every once in a while one of the true gems comes along and it s originality just blows you away haruhi is truly one of those shows many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is rather poorly done and doesn t utilize the benefits animation has over static drawings haruhi is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders beautiful animation great voice acting great music and a complete and well paced story watch it you won t be disappointed and i d suggest watching it in broadcast order it works so much better that way ,1
crispin glovers way of acting and not only his is tremendous you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect he gives layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult as well as feck which role is done very well by dennis hopper it s about choosing the right or wrong side without logical thinking about the scene friendship is more imported and that s exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers i really enjoyed it watching i saw it a month ago for the first time but if you like a nice 80s feel this is the one that you have to see i ts a same that i didn t know of it earlier ,1
the haunting a remake of course the original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that has improved with time compared to this 1999 remake it s a classic there is no character development here only caricatures the slut the authoritative brain the i m gonna get us outta here fellow the oh so sensitive bookworm but seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the star i guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern unfortunately the effects are laughable mewing cherubs stretchy doors irritating dead children that can t speak plainly and an idiotically sappy ending that does it s darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows ill take my skittles orally thank you bruce dern i ve liked you since the cowboys stop it ,0
i watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar for dollar it it probably one of the worst films ever now i am not saying it s the worst film ever but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it this is a very very bad film i would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer director michael cimino rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person had he not been so self indulgent a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes saving the studio millions the film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that s supposed to be set at harvard the scene is huge but completely without context you have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students in particular john hurt are behaving so boorishly i find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870 and it looks a lot more like 1970 this is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening who the characters are or their motivations the next scene is 20 years later inexplicably the two harvard grads hurt and kris kristofferson are in wyoming so they went to the best school in america and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is well what is john hurt in the film he just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk the prologue or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers even though he is apparently against them his entire character made no sense they never explained why he was a brit living in the middle of nowhere it was impossible to hide his accent why he bothered to come along with the hired army if he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn t believe in at all as for kristofferson his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable though having him move to wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all this brings up the worst aspect of heaven s gate while the scenes are way too long and needed trimming the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard john hurt a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film jeff bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why in fact other than kristofferson isabelle huppert as a hooker with a heart of gold quite the cliché and perhaps christopher walken everyone is completely one dimensional it s hard to imagine a movie this long where you don t know or understand the characters much of the film also seems anachronistic who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890 i am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very very difficult and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of food maybe if they hadn t spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink the farmers could have afforded to buy food and avoided this war over purloined cattle and what s with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle what did this have to do with a land war the most obvious problem you are left with is that it s a film where very very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film there are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness so much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it s inevitable that nothing could salvage the film as for the final battle it was done reasonably well but had problems first this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the d day invasion second while details of the actual events of the so called johnson county war are a tad sketchy we do know that the characters played by huppert and kristofferson never actually were there as they d both been hung before the battle third i can t believe that cimino actually killed animals throughout the film especially during the final battle while i am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve cimino s vision for the film is very sad finally after the big battle we have an epilogue while it is blessedly short it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague we see kristofferson on a fancy yacht so we can assume that he s finally putting some of that harvard education to work for himself we also see a woman who appears to be one that kris looked at a couple times during the prologue most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome i read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong overall to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying wwii was a minor tiff well i ve certainly seen a lot worse but if you factor in the cost of production i truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history finally when a film has this much explicit nudity i warn parents however as no child could sit through this film even with a promise of sex the warning is not necessary ,0
 some spoilers it took some 19 years for bruce campbell to finally put his masterpiece man with the screaming brain on the screen but campbell had to alter his story by having it due to financial problems take place in sofia bulgaria not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in los angeles california in the film burce campbell plays us pharmaceutical tycoon willian cole who travels together with his spoiled rotten wife jackie antoinette byron to the former communist republic of bulgaria it s there that william wants to help finance bulgaria s almost non existent mass transportation system it s poor william s misfortune to get involved with both gypsy woman tatoya tamara gorski and her ex boyfriend yegor valdimir kolev an ex kgb taxi driver the two william yegor will unwittingly end up shearing their brains inside william s skull because of tatoya s jealousy and vindictiveness after tatoya murders both william and yegor their bodies are delivered to mad scientist dr ivan ivanowitch ivanov stacy keach by his loyal assistant pavel ted raimi to have their brains experimented with dr ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better then one and now with the material william yegor available to him dr ivanov at last is finally going to prove it what dr ivanov is going to sadly find out is that by fusing the two heads or brains together their brain waves will overlap and cause them to not only malfunction but turn against each other william with yegor s right lobe fused into his damaged brain is out to find tatoya and make her pay for the damage she caused both him and yegor yegor for his part is stuck in william s head who s likes and dislikes in both food and drink are totally opposite to his own this causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of william s body things get even more screwed up when jackie finding out that tatoya murdered her husband william confront her in the dangerous and high crime section of bravoda call gypsy town and ends up being murdered herself brought back to dr ivanov by his assistant pavel it s determined with no body available to plant jackie s brain inside of an experimental robot that pavel s been working on the operation is a rousing success but the only drawback is that jackie with her brain inside the robot has to have her brain recharged every few hours or like a real brain lacking oxygen she ll die together with the robot s batteries combination 1930 s like screw ball comedy and horror flick with both william yegor turning the bulgarian town of bravoda upside down in trying to find tatoya and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence she put them both into spoiler alert it s dr ivanov who in fact saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains from fighting and thus cooperating with each other this is done by him instead of fusing the brains together dr ivanov keep them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall in between the two uncooperative globs of gray matter ,1
this is unfortunately carlin s last recorded hbo concert from a series that lasted over 30 years though this may not be his best work it is excellent funny and thought provoking this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts throughout his long prolific and influential career carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes towards a more humanitarian viewpoint of society and culture his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years and culminates in this performance though i would argue that his audio book when will jesus bring the pork chops best displays his vast wit with regards to language euphemisms and the breakdown of our values it s bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church you will probably not like any of carlin s stand up material however if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy you would probably greatly enjoy this concert ,1
there s no romance or other side plot to this movie it s action and intrigue all the way making it a real man s kung fu movie an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who s styles represents five venomous animals centipede snake scorpion lizard and the toad despite the word venom in the title none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents yan tieh told by his teacher that he s no match for the five former pupil must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung fu action movies it s known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story it s no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them one movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan ,1
i understand the jokes quite well they just aren t good the show is horrible i understand it and that s another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it s not funny not funny i don t want people to say only smart people get it because if they re so smart why do they judge people they don t even know and say that they re not smart or intellectual enough to understand it it s like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them they re just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting i m not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they don t even know anything about any of us isn t exactly a smart comment ,0
 gaming nicotine fisticuffs we re moving in a descending spiral of iniquity so says the head of st swithen s upon inspecting the master s common at nutbourne the faculty and students of st swithen s have been ordered to share facilities at nutbourne to avoid german bombs during world war ii then there s the masters library the diary of samuel pepys abridged well that s something to be thankful for what s up here the memoirs of casanova wasn t that the book we caught jessica james reading in the closet decameron nights well really what ever else this place may or may not be it s no place to bring carefully nurtured girls yes a terrible mistake has been made by the ministry of education nutbourne is a school for boys st swithen s is a school for girls and what makes this one of the best post wwii british comedies nutbourne s head master is wetherby pond played by alastair sim while st swithen s head mistress is muriel whitchurch played by margaret rutherford st swithen s says pond you don t mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls he asks one of the early girls only girls she says cheerfully does this mean sir asks one of nutbourne s teachers that we are to expect 100 young girls it means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration margaret rutherford s miss whitchurch as positive and immovable as a battleship intends to make the best of it by briskly taking over nutbourne if possible alastair sim s pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school in the meantime there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep along with all their teachers the cooks and caretakers totally put upon walk out miss whitchurch and her girls however are up to the cooking tasks come now angela she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot haven t you made porridge before yes but no one ever had to eat it that s a defeatist attitude my dear stir it well and don t shilly shally things are hardly going well when pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led nutbourne is and miss whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new boy free they were told facilities the only solution miss whitchurch and pond their teachers and their students concoct a split second shifting of classes to give the allusion that nutbourne has no girls and that st swithen s has no boys after the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who d been hidden under leap up into the beds just as the governors walk in the boys are observed at rugby and as soon as the governors turn their backs the goal posts are taken down nets for lacrosse are put up and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls one parent spots her daughter in a science class then moments later sees her in a choir practice then moments later there s angela again she says to miss whitchurch why so it is she replies hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner the child s quite ubiquitous when we leave nutbourne everything has been discovered the students are milling about the teachers are dazed except for two who are kissing the education ministry has just sent several more busloads of students the parents are speechless but the governors are not we re waiting for an explanation one says sharply pond holds his head and shudders can t you see i m trying to think of one the film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by rutherford and sim sim s droll exasperation and rutherford s implacable determination are so well matched that s it s a shame this is the only movie they ever made together joyce grenfell as gossage st swithen s tall awkward loping sports teacher gives them some competition if you keep your eyes open you ll also find some amusing references director frank launder works in including a gong at nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of j arthur rank s a faint echo of the zither theme from the third man and a shot stolen from david lean s oliver twist except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says please sir i don t want anymore frank launder and his partner sidney gilliat were responsible for some of the best films produced in britain during the thirties forties and fifties they wrote produced and directed sometimes doing one sometimes the other in one way or another they were responsible for such first rate films as green for danger with a masterly droll performance by sim i see a dark stranger the lady vanishes night train to munich wee geordie the belles of st trinian s the rake s progress and many others with the happiest days of your life launder wrote and directed while both produced it s one of their best ,1
the comments of the previous user are harsh indeed one wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet film as for being so nasty about it in front of the writer director well thats just plain rude for those who grew up in the eighties it is an artful piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced irish film making sure has a lot of bitter angry people involved with it and the spleen venting comment made about this is evidence of it as people we have a choice give out and moan about the people who actually go out there and make stuff or make something yourself i know which one is easier do yourself a favour and watch this film and see how a short film is made you won t be disappointed,1
i had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me a wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of australian commandos who tried to sink some japanese ships at the singapore harbor during the height of ww2 these commandos are caught in plain clothes and they are considered to be spies by the japanese captors but something happens that hasn t been explored much in any hollywood ww2 movie that i have seen a close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives they begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior japanese prison guard this is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart soon one day as the two friends are conversing the aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the jap ships in the singapore harbor he mentions that it was his team and not some other s that had sunk the ships to his japanese friend and upon hearing this the japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed but the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the japanese authorities finally the japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules this is the highest honor accorded to the captured warriors in japan this is the most awesome part of the film where the aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his aussie friend confess being guilty i won t give away the ending here but it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears all in all an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn t get the recognition that it deserved internationally get one copy today and be mesmerized ,1
 crossfire is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that s a murder mystery with a strong message it stars robert young robert mitchum robert ryan sam levene and gloria grahame and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film young as the detective finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why the victim joseph samuels sam levene is someone the soldiers meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and samuels winds up dead i don t know about 1947 but seeing crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects i don t suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing anti semite language the characterizations are vivid including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role she s a woman who meets mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an alibi the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone is excellent robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife truly excellent and a must see ,1
gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama but i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared harriss who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma hopefully without poor richards penchant for hellraising and haminess and charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life and making magic in the dark ,1
now after watching the advent children twice the storyline isn t as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion if you haven t played ffvii or disliked it for whatever reason this movie is most likely not for you being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding ac fully otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so far without actually spoiling the storyline i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of ffvii seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered some were not ac is clearly for ffvii players fans and doesn t honestly try to be anything else there is little to none realism in it outside ffvii world which serves the purpose music is mostly reconstructed ffvii themes with a heavier touch tbm team according to end credits and works well with the eye candy without exceptions i found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations we all know you can t put a ffvii in 1 5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected there are two issues at hand in ffvii ac and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences and trust me when i say there s a lot of it action that is i m changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because i had missed a few explanatory sequences i couldn t put together the first time that provided some answers as a warning it s going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics but try not to judge the adevent children because of that if you don t let the story in it s no wonder it seems sloppy i m not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome which might be an understatement especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole get ready for the ride of your life there are no breaks ,1
i m a big time horror fan and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards well let me tell you i don t know whom was giving it all the hype but let me speak on a few things first of all this film is not a lot of things it is not scary not suspenseful not overly gory not overly sick except for one season maybe not beautifully scored at all the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in greece because they have done a little naughtiness in london we don t even know what they did but it is presumed that they killed someone spoiler alert the male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of cleansing the island of perverts oddly enough the killings are cheap the characters are cheaper and the effects suck there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning but even that is done without any care for how it is shot end of spoilersthe end of the movie is about the only thing that isn t totally predictable i especially enjoyed when the herder farts on the husband anyway if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead it s nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread 3 10,0
why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie burt reynolds peaked then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero and here loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this family adventure flick which is an unbelievably tedious childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis s great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film the story is pure humdrum it concerns social worker murphy contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one chosen for what i hear you ask his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world as the main demon classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film but hey i m sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents of all murphy s films this is easily the worst i ve read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role in a non formulaic kind of film and while both points are loosely true there s no forgiving the fact that the film however atypical and non formulaic it might be is an absolute load of garbage ,0
by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol flynn s hold over u s box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler the first of these was a good one actually adventures of don juan 1948 but it also proved to be his last big budget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his sword wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of ballantrae 1953 and the dark avenger 1955 in france for adventures of captain fabian 1951 and italy for the aborted the story of william tell 1953 and the little seen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways albeit for a modestly budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers a production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red headed leading lady maureen o hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger than life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie the pirate captain roc brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of falworth 1954 a viewing of which preceded this one against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels for all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie i ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about as i said earlier against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the amorous persistence of the child like indian princess alice kelley towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk 1940 and the black swan 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars is briskly paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the king s pirate 1967 with doug mcclure for what it s worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly thought out pirates of the golden age movie collection set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer s girl 1950 with yvonne de carlo doule crossbones 1951 with donald o connor and yankee buccaneer 1952 with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk s mutiny 1952 the afore mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga 1961 ,1
what a preposterous story murder blackmail child sex allegations gays and the catholic church absolute tripe how is it that most uk based tv dramas sit coms etc have to include the obligortory gay its really getting tiresome now everybody accepts that there are gay people in society just has there are other minority groups but we don t want it ramming down our throats i ll pass on this one in every single show apart from the above the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black i am surprised at c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script ,0
mind you it s not supposed to be but it is as a wee tot i watched this movie in the theatre being a huge wrestling and hulk hogan fan all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that i didn t really like it very much i blacked the rest out and for good reason a poor film on par with the greats like gymkata and the pumaman no holds barred is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling well maybe the stakes aren t all that high and quite frankly i feel dirty just calling these people professionals at anything and really except for the first scene there s no wrestling to speak of so i guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating the c out of people sounds good right hulk hogan plays rip the champion of the wwf never let it be said that hulk hogan was typecast this and movies like thunder in paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents essentially he s playing himself but with a wardrobe that s more black and blue than the hulkster s red and yellow he also has this hand gesture he does it s kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts except you stick your thumb in the air and you curl your index finger in my friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an r try and see for yourself if that looks like an r well then mars needs women but anyway kurt fuller with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz plays a tv exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting rip who s evidentally bigger than elvis on his network he won t have any of it and exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera and so the movie follows fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at rip he does so when he creates his brilliantly titled battle of the tough guys marketing genius this guy from the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fight scenes all played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious to the overacting to the far too frequent shots of hulk in nothing but undies this movie has everything you d ever want in a dumb movie it s frivolous not too taxing on the mind violent and includes the phrase what s that smell dookie dookie a classic for all time ,0
edith nesbitt s best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film i love it the film itself has gorgeous cinematography and fine realisation of the subject matter the ending is enough to have you in tears as it is so beautifully done lionel has directed some truly excellent films like the amazing mr blunden but this is his best film as director by a mile the costumes were absolutely lovely that matched the beauty of the countryside and the sparkling and conveniently faithful script helped matters however it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together as it is nothing shorter than incredible dinah sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother a much needed characteristic of the character and bernard cribbins was hilarious as perks in fact i preferred perks on film as he isn t as humorous in the book the children were perfect gary warren and sally thomsett both gave spirited performances but it is jenny agutter s enchanting portrayal of bobbie that impressed me the most another special mention is the gorgeous music by johnny douglas the title music reminded me of charlie chaplin s smile in conclusion a funny and poignant masterpiece that is better than the book i think 10 10 bethany cox ,1
jim wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded komodo vs cobra no guesswork here a giant cgi komodo dragon it sort of looks like a dog minus fur takes on a humongous cgi king cobra with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between the tree huggers get charter boat captain michael pare who else to take them to an off limits federal island an experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters thank so to our nutty military now all that s left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientist s tiny shapely daughter the group runs into her at the old plantation lab the monsters arrive and the chase is on if you watch enough wynorski sci fi channel flicks you ll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies acting is nonexistent as is the plot at the very least you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up the cobra just strikes and swallows no imagination at all ,0
this movie wasn t too funny it wasn t too horrible either just a fun ride aboard the soul plane it s a black owned flight service with a kick ass disco beautiful bar and pumping stewards the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black not race or color but style owned plane with the same style of black humor at times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the normal lavatory in the normal plane check that out there are lulls however and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot watch to find out who it is all in all it s a fun movie tom arnold adds to the fun with his cracker attitude this is one movie to watch when playing poker when you re drunk or just vegging ,0
from the brilliant mind that brought us the exorcist and cruising rampage is unfortunately more like the latter it s an overall messy movie that has a major made for tv vibe going for it the whole film pretends to hinge on the question what if the boy next door was a serial killer but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the the insanity plea and death penalty that makes little sense the movie is very loosely based on the richard trenton chase case culling a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome one of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow analagous sometimes you just have to choose says the lead character yeah sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug on your tv ,0
early talkie feature based on a popular stage play a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is while the lights are out there s another murder so it s someone in that room what follows is an obvious dull and creaky murder mystery most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree they act like they re on stage where you have to overdo things and it looks silly on screen most embarrassing is bela lugosi two years before dracula who really overdoes it as a police inspector static direction by tod browning who was always overrated doesn t help for browning and lugosi completists only i give it a 3 ,0
 red sonja is flawed weak and lacking even the camp ness isn t good there are only two good things about red sonja the costumes even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous it s ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men because she was raped still choose to wear so few little clothes even when it rains and the music by ennio morricone still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable the story is extremely simple and they didn t even bother to make it interesting the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady i don t know who s accent is worse hers or arnie s and on top of that she can t act there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable even worse was sandahl bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role but my god he looked horrible he changed so much since his only well known role in raiders of the lost ark maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991 and by the way what was with all those raiders of the lost ark actors in this movie next to ronald lacey pat roach terry richards and tutte lemkow appeared in a role it seemed like some kind of raiders of the lost ark reunion the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the sword fights even though some of them are needless and weak only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy genre 4 10,0
this movie gives golf a high mark it was well acted and well directed giving you a view of history that some non sports fans will enjoy the historic factor alone gives it a high rating the brookline golf course was really done well i am in the northeast and have seen brookline as a fan and as someone who loves the game the movie was well done on all levels a must see 5 stars the acting was superb disney has another winner in its bag of great movies if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life i would tell you that the setting while in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s is very realistic the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film a must see for fans and non fans alike ,1

when carol vanessa hidalgo starts looking into her brother s death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes the closer she gets to the truth the more of a threat she becomes to her sister in law fiona helga line and the rest of the local satanists they ll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways if you re into sleazy satanic themed movies black candles has a lot to offer the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft core sex one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed unfortunately all the sleaze in the world can t save black candles most of the movie is a total bore other than the one scene i ve already mentioned the numerous sex scenes aren t shocking and certainly aren t sexy the acting is spotty at best even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance the plot really doesn t matter its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together i m only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror black candles comes off as amateurish 3 10 is about the best i can do ,0
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out i now consider myself a masochist afghanistan come on guys who s the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards i thought the lead actor george calil was particularly inept apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake i thought using the events of 9 11 as a reason to make larson the lunatic implodes all over a screen near you disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9 11 using a phone call from larson s wife sarah supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day was appalling the camera shake didn t make me feel sick that cold hearted stunt did ,0
i guess this is the first time i have seen a roscoe fatty arbuckle movie i really liked him in his title role as a butcher boy the way he moves is very funny in my opinion for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette i think he is a good actor his facial expressions really suit the role he plays for example how he winks at the audience in the end but one might add that that was probably not too difficult anyway i think he would have deserved a longer career as you probably know it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal the plot is not very important in the first half fatty and alum are employees at a store and rivals for almondine s affection after a heavy food fight almondine is sent to a girls school by her father the store owner this is the beginning of the second half both fatty and alum enter the school in drag and the fight for almondine continues some of the characters names are different in the version that i have seen it seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones there are a lot of corny gags like food fights and pratfalls but they are done well in my opinion and there are some gags i really liked for example how they make the dog run the pepper mill or is it a coffee mill or the scene when fatty dons a coat although it is obviously not necessary or when miss teachem the head of the girls school spanks fatty and he spanks her back buster keaton is also funny in this his first movie a good addition to the cast in the first half he is a customer at the store in the second half he supports alum in his fight for almondine i liked his acrobatics for example when fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another he doesn t show a simple pratfall but lands on his hands and his head and does a little pirouette watch out for one scene in the food fight alum throws a flour bag at him but it misses and hits the store owner instead that makes buster laugh which must be a rarity since he normally always shows a neutral expression which as you probably also know already got him the nickname the great stone face one more note al st john who plays alum was fatty arbuckle s nephew and later became famous for the role of fuzzy that he played in lots of westerns i don t like this one as much as i like for example one week and the balloonatic films that buster made later without fatty and it didn t make me laugh out loud often but it made me smile a lot so i have given it eight points ,1
if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodes ka den it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didn t stop delivering what he s infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn t be ignored but it s not at all a fault of kurosawa s the material in dodes ka den is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there s things that happen to these people and kurosawa s challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there s not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged man child who goes around all day making train sounds the clickety clack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there s the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site specific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he s lost a lot more than he ll tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle i m not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social around there are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there s the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there s a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it s about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it s a little post apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it s a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathly looking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it sometimes there s charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawa s cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as they ve always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them i e the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it s one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it s like the abstract has come full throttle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it s a brilliant tricky double edged sword that allows for the dream like intonations with such heavy duty drama with a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodes ka den is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality ,1
not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a b western story line was so so but the filming editing and acting were just plain bad plus the music in the background was irritating to no end too loud and just non stop many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music i m in sass single action shooting society and do some old west shooting with them and a lot of the actors are members of this group so that s why i bought it if you have no interest in this group of people or that sport you certainly most likely wouldn t even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film the acting of even the veteran actors particularly stella stevens left a lot to be desired also ,0
gen y cops since i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen x cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas tse didn t return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own way stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match who has a steady girl in oli note where is haze and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as edison i also enjoyed paul rudd s performance of agent curtis he seems to be the tough as nails smartmouth fbi agent you d love to hate but soon you d like his character the fight scenes are a lot better in this one even though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match smoorenburg also is the stunt double for rudd if you liked gen x cops you ll love gen y cops ,1

despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired toshiharu ikeda who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film evil dead trap shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot predictable stalking harassing assault and rape ensues the staple of roman porno is sex and sex mixed with violence both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening via condom is too little kink to late the series rain motif continues and the film s final scene brings relief ,0

it s not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film this was however simply the worst movie i have ever seen the performances were laughable at best at worst they were well there s no other word for it awful especially the lead female who s random sexual come ons have to be seen and heard to be believed honestly the plot is nonsensical the dialogue appalling and the characterisation there is none i m surprised it s not an alan smithee film i can t stress this strongly enough avoid at all costs how do movies like this ever get made this is no budget film making at its very very worst ,0
films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french cinema this film was about the mundane it didn t have a much of a plot it was just characters who lived in a town very normal people and stuff just happened but it wasn t very interesting stuff and it wasn t examined very insightfully the film did capture a bit of a mood but it wasn t a particularly captivating mood and while i can t think of much that the film did specifically wrong it failed on just about every level to do anything right there were a lot of characters in this film a lot of them kind of looked alike so it was hard to figure out who was who and what were their relations to one another i don t mind putting some effort into understanding a film or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant functional not brilliant but pleasant the camera often captured some nice postcard type shots but it rarely found the really interesting little details i ve seen a handful of not so good films so far at the seattle international film festival but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it 4 10,0
i really liked this film all three stars connery fishburne and underwood give credible performances and harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it 7 of 10 ,1
does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by george ede aka father fitzpatrick in the move it had to be you he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving if not i will have to rent the movie this was a great movie i also loved serendipity great love story for the soul i met my one true love my soulmate and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it i wasn t ready for that kind of emotional relationship altho we did marry i wasn t mature enough to give as much as i thought i would i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry in disbelief about the way it turned out i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me i know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry don t ever get complacent and take true love for granted it has been the hardest lesson of my life also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting true love is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what it will happen nothing is impossible even when it s the second time around thanks ,1
in luchino visconti s film death in venice it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays but in the pursuit of beauty itself gustav von aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man to understand the decay we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us it is best described and explained in a quote from socrates found in thomas mann s version of death in venice beauty alone is lovely and visible at once it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our senses else what if the divine if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses should we not perish and become consumed by love we see in the film this very thing happen the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty which turns into a longing for the boy tadzio even though the levelheaded part of his mind tells him that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandon he cannot contain himself it would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film early on we see the extravagance of the parlor and we are treated to a perfect summarization of turn of the century upper class life all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer pasqualino de santis but visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of venice instead the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty and these things are relegated to the past the city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff the streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot the city decays in step with the protagonist only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man the death of his daughter and presumably his wife along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself alfred with whom aschenbach has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it but alfred is more than a friend he is aschenbach s alter ego and what alfred says articulates the composer s own doubts and fears the scene in which aschenbach decides to leave venice is immediately followed by a clip of alfred telling him that he is weak alienated and lacks feelings in the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all it is a decay of memory rather than objective renderings of the past these flashbacks become distorted memories we can say that these are decayed memories because even aschenbach alludes to it he declares reality distracts and degrades us and following the scene in the travel agent s office we see aschenbach confront tadzio and his family and warn them leave venice but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of gustav mahler he allows the viewer s mind to wander as we watch aschenbach s life and respectability decay with the beauty around him slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth the crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged man s attraction to tadzio it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed even in fantasy the beauty of this polish boy kindles a fire in him that at first makes him glow then consumes him the film concludes with von aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching tadzio fight with his friend we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood it is a vision of his life s expiring moments though before his last breath the final decay has happened all around him the city is soiled and with it he has become what he detests as aschenbach dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film a man that had disturbed him it was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise and that of the city around him his sensuality is indulged in while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay it is these three themes that tie the damned and death in venice together beauty death and decay these themes are visconti s art the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself in this film we are treated to the deliquescence of one great man we see the honored composer gustav von aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable lonely death watching the target of his affection i believe that through these movies visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last decay is intrinsic in the world around us and when we become distracted it can destroy the splendor in death in venice it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in visconti s works at once beautiful and destructive it is these themes that define his art ,1
one of john s funniest eugene levy is great in this one as well just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd i have it on video tape but feel that this film deserves dvd and extras would be great the kung fu uuniversity kung fu u skit is so very funny as is the entire film also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great this movie never seems to be on tv but it loses most of it s hilarity when edited for broadcast tv if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it ebay is a good place to find a copy i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them ,1
i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself am i going crazy can t i see the beauty from a film like this am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out i don t know maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well the film idea was going nowhere i was sure it would have a foggy end and of course it did nothing exceptional not even the landscapes i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice but no just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students now all grown up each of them with his her own fixed ideas and boy some of those ideas were stupid like the lizard story for example at a moment i thought i was watching x files with the lizard entering in the ear and all no from my point of view this movie is a waste of time not to say money if u pay for the ticket the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye german kid he played very well and convincing for his age the rest nothing i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film i think to myself again maybe i am the crazy one advice don t waste your time with this ,0
black water has to be one of the best australian movies i ve seen in many years my girlfriend and i sat gripping each others hands jumping in all the right spots this is as much a crocodile film as open water was a shark film in other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances how director s andrew traucki and david nerlich wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold and when i say terror its not overblown artificially constructed squirm moments but more little touches that when you ask yourself how would i feel in that situation lead you to conclude scared witless performances were great the pacing and gorgeous cutaways to other life in the mangroves were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right this is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film ,1
there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great sadly like bring it on 2 bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film the performance of hayden panattiere was sub par both in terms of acting and cheerleading there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene lines plot etc were just so stupid my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the acting of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film only great character kirresha ,0
oh cgi a blessing when used properly a sin with it s used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly that s not the only thing that s used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip off ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 i like low budget horror movies and 2 if there is a cute guy in said low budget movie i ll usually point them out so let s just get this out of the way right now this is one low budget horror movie i didn t like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i ve witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boy dax miller bog wins that prize hands down this boy is hot and surprisingly he s not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way let s get on with it in cliff notes version here s the story don t worry i ll try not to give anything away a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end credits as i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what s with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat i don t think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see the cgi is horrendous and they ve even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs attention filmmakers national geographic discovery store the croc hunter they know what crocodiles look like you obviously didn t reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and what s with the pirate drug pusher gang did you just need another reason to rip off a woman s top it s funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world with alligator and it s sequels lake placid crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake placid was good i even thought tobe hooper s crocodile was good blood surf sucked my grade d ,0
considering the film s reputation as truly the worst of the worst i was looking forward to watching wood s crappus opus my word it s not necessarily any more inept than the other woods i ve watched however being from the reefer madness 1938 school of film making glen or glenda doesn t come across as readily enjoyable as his genre efforts also this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosi s nadir his first of three collaborations with the director one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was considering the actor s history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo besides lugosi s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here though wood s script is mostly to blame for this given the impossible dialogue with repeated nonsensical allusions to puppy dog tails and big fat snails he handed the ailing star by the way wood himself plays the central role under the pseudonym daniel davis and being just as worthless in this area proves to have been an all round dog dolores fuller his wife and co star was similarly untalented she would also appear in jail bait 1954 but at the very least the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burton s affectionate biopic ed wood 1994 its famous poster incidentally the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles well for all intents and purposes glen or glenda constitutes ed wood s citizen kane 1941 given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques in fact the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore many of it irrelevant such as the bewildering instances of s m and inane dream sequences highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy the film s sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction phenomenon of transvestism is however sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach for what it s worth the edition i watched was the extended re issue version which included six minutes of depraved footage directed by w merle connell censored on original release furthermore my copy went out of synch every so often which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track though thankfully this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself ,0
although a tear jerker it is definitely a feel good movie all the actors were excellent and will smith as always does the job and does it well i could go on but pick any ten of the 10 ratings and they ve said it as well and likely better than i could but since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come and this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor ,1
this columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites the cast includes rosemary s baby john cassavetes as the maestro his wife played by blythe danner gwyneth paltrow s mom and his mother in law played by myrna loy one of america s greatest leading actresses in film of our time anyway i disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film this episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing i love watching columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series this time the episode focuses in on classical music at the hollywood bowl one of l a s attractions of course columbo becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime ,1
i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can t remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of it s time 8 out of 10 kids ,1
dumb excuse for a thriller with absolutely zero chemistry or reason in relationship between lewis and hurt why is she dating a man old enough to be her father anyway the suspense is laughable lewis is very good but a script is needed and there isn t one my score for this trash 2 out of 10 ,0
this is one of my favorite films for many reasons to begin there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princess dancing girl from michael rennie as the villain handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city state and others the film is an unusually colorful adventure and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs for once she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side also the photography the costumes by travilla lionel newman s music and the film s style are unusually fine add to this rousing action intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald drayson adams script set in 1249 ad and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized near eastern but there is much to praise about the unusual and well developed storyline here as there is much more to praise other than the film s swift pace well managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects classically trained actors such as michael ansara edgar barrier wally cassell jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one b film together nor are there fascinating sets a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here one way of assessing a film is if i were guaranteed to live through the experience would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions since my answer is a resounding yes in this case this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated cinematic work could it be that us critics all too frequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to misprize this estimable film s obvious anti tyranny and pro entertainment qualities ,1
grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long it s nearing 4 am here and because it s norwegian which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now a droll and deliciously wry romp this movie features a man andreas who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste nothing smells and even sex loses its appeal driven to the edge by his lack of common senses he feels nearly ready to kill himself after an hilarious botched attempt at latter andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny vagina shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see but of course in fantasy allegory land desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end andreas attempt at freedom and sensuality jens lien and crew create a simple straight forward movement to the story one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging the similarities in other similar science fiction aren t worth enumerating but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray toned mise en scene trond fausa aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings which works very well despite the fact that the concept itself isn t anything to write home about everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world polarisdib,1
i once promised never to walk out of any film a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck such as rambo 3 baise moi deep impact but mr seidl almost succeeded hundstage was a truly awful experience anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable pathetic bunch of retards it shows a world where love and humanity don t exist a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason to distract from their own miserable existence by choosing a documentary like style with non professional actors most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock cartoonist deix director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian european western suburbs the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies violence against women and handicapped people madness and degradation but this isn t social criticism this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value instead you get bad acting bad cinematography bad filmmaking if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes this is pseudo social criticism with a sledge hammer and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way it shows ugly people that is not the reason why i hate it but it depicts average people in an ugly misanthropic way and this is why this film is truly despicable ,0
i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very very free adaptation from the work of eça de queiroz and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters the problem is the way that is done without any care without any taste just a rumble of bad taste clichés everywhere the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that s makes petty seeing nice actors as unas bryner morgado lagarto and others lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling for my surprise the newcomers jorge corrula and soraia chaves bravely stick in their performances but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction and talking about direction this seems to be something totally missing on this movie where s the director everything is bad taste the frames are whatever and whenever the use of hand camera without any justified reason the light design that should build environments doesn t exist and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story the problem overall in this trying to be film is that as no taste or very very bad taste it s sad to see jorge and soraia melting away in such fake and gratuity sex scenes painted here and there trough out the movie like closing narratives holes or used as fakes transition motives maybe carlos coelho da silva should see the 2002 carlos carrera adaptation of the same book of eça and get the felling of how to build a true movie ,0
i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature that said the simplistic notion that ingmar bergman s great 1968 film shame or skammen is merely an anti war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors persona and hour of the wolf shame is seemingly a more classic film in terms of narrative but the key word is seemingly for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of persona and the gaudy horror film homages of hour of the wolf it is one of the best films ever made about war and not as an anti war film nor a pro war film as such it has to rank with wild strawberries as one of his greatest films as well as one of his best screenplays if not the best although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive in it max von sydow and liv ullman play jan and eva rosenberg perhaps a nod at the infamous american spies whom many european intellectuals felt were innocent two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island content to working in a greenhouse the country they live in is unnamed as is the island they live on although the film was made on bergman s small island of farö just off the northern end of the swedish island of göttland it seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province this is all left deliberately hazy as this war is meant to symbolize all wars this is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen as the credits roll these include quotes from hitler to vietnam era american military figures after early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life and then the coming of war where even old men are conscripted an aerial attack ravages the rosenbergs land as enemy jets fly overhead dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an agent orange like nature one plane is hit and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree jan who starts off the film as a sniveling coward refuses to go and help so eva goes alone jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot it seems he is indeed part of the invading or possibly rebel force a bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot then advise the couple to leave their home as the invaders are near there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level such as that of bergman scholar marc gervais who provides the film commentary on the dvd of the film like many other critics he claims that jacobi is a quisling who has collaborated with the invaders but this is clearly and demonstrably wrong for jacobi is with the original fascist government as proof first off the invaders are repelled after they invade the rosenbergs land and shoot their agitprop interview we know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview and words put into eva s mouth see the film as supposed proof of their treason and jacobi is clearly working with them the fascist big brother statists secondly jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps for collaborating with the invaders and the rosenbergs again are among those spared thirdly in his seduction of eva jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military and clearly if he was an invader he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state also rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official leave lastly filip is clearly with the rebels or invaders of the organization and why would he have killed a colleague that gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly misinterpret and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of bergman s films this is a wonderful and great film and very high in the berman canon but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message instead opting out for the cheap lazy and easy claim of its being merely anti war and a rather simple film in comparison to its two showier predecessors and that in the long run is the real shame of shame ,1
antwone fisher s story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children abandoned by a troubled mother antwone has never met his father growing up with church going abusers who use the n word not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold up enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the navy antwone s anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a navy psychiatrist and a love enters his life the scene where antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film stunned by the unexpected confrontation the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime addictions to drugs fathering children left and right all despite his utterly adverse circumstances if that scene wasn t powerful enough the very next one drives it home and opens the flood gates a reception to welcome home antwone dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family one of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children even if some of the homes and administrators don t seem to care and appear self serving many do give it their all the character who found antwone s file once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those bright lights in the darkness of the system the dvd includes a french language track various subtitle choices as well as additional features and information about foster parenting as a clevelander i appreciated the location footage no matter where you are from you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem ,1

viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent however the german film version which had english captions was her greatest performance greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films this story was very sad because greta garbo anna christie ninotchka 39 was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain there were many scenes of old nyc the brooklyn bridge coney island and the sky line of manhattan charles bickford matt burke days of wine roses 62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role ,1
this is an emperor s new clothes situation someone needs to say that s not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film don t waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are all too realistically only themselves they have no lines they don t act the american dream is not to create shoddy no quality films or anything else shoddy and of no quality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it can t have been made in hollywood can it would try to impute any kind of quality to this film it s worse than ed woods another film about a film maker without standards these films shouldn t have been made and you shouldn t go see american movie ,0
david zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce yes it s a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts the film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you ll likely miss them like his previous efforts which include airplane top secret and naked gun the humor flies out almost every second there are so many moments that work it s easy to overlook the few that fall flat what sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line while others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies take mafia please this film tells a new story with likable characters it touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies even for people who don t care for south park its creators matt stone and trey parker make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry the film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes sports announcers and other celebrities especially a hilarious bit with robert stack of unsolved mysteries by the way stay through the credits for a final joke with bob costas and al michaels all in all zucker has achieved in words perhaps applying to the movie s mix of sports a home dunk ,1
this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now family and friends feel the same way about it this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies this is a must see movie it s a family and romantic movie this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction this movie is must see recommended to everyone ,1

tycoon will never be listed as one of john wayne s better post stagecoach film it s good in spots has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax but the plot leaves a lot to be desired what we have in tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team multimillionaire cedric hardwicke has hired john wayne and james gleason to build a railroad but then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right things get really complicated when wayne falls for hardwicke s daughter laraine day after a night when they have to spend time alone in an inca ruin by convention in south america wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another their petty spites cause some fatalities among wayne s crew but what tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness laraine day was married to leo durocher the manager of the brooklyn dodgers when this was being filmed he was a constant presence on the set insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife nothing to it but he made his wife s life miserable not one of the duke s better efforts ,0
you like to solve mysteries you like complex narrations this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis leclerc son of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc strongly helped by roy dupuis who s dythirambic in the lead role the plot is about alexandre tourneur veterinary in his 40 s who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer s sufferings on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my hypothesis on the ending i think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any explanations i strongly recommend it 9 5 10,1
if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes this cartoon is not for you but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation come on in in this cartoon popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat the two japanese fishermen trick popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed but looks can be deceiving the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship what follows is considered today to be morale boosting propaganda be forewarned the representations of the japanese in the film are done in a mean spirited fashion keep in mind though that there was a war going on at the time but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era ,1
a hard to find film which coasts on the still pervasive mythology of senator joe mccarthy as a political demon king boyle as joe gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the wisconsin senator the caricature mccarthy many take as the real one meredith as wily army lawyer joseph welch who outsmarted mccarthy at the army hearings in 1954 is very good as always in fact mccarthy and cohn were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the army and the 1954 army hearings became enmeshed in the smokescreen used by the army to deflect the investigation away from their security failings which the committee were investigating by counter charging that mccarthy and cohn were trying to get favours for their staffer david schine whilst in the service the film is self satisfied agenda driven polemic based in the pervasive myths which have passed for the truth with many people for decades that the red scare was essentially phony and mccarthy huac etc were always blasting away at the wrong targets being no more than lying career ruining publicity hounds who were trampling over the constitutional rights of startled innocent liberals who were accused of being security risks communists people who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating misinformation on mccarthy and the red scare to this day clooney s murrow hagiography is an example the misinformation is pervasive no wonder people have swallowed it a recent obit of budd schulberg in the serious left wing uk newspaper the guardian headlined that the hollywood writer named names to mccarthy perpetuating the lie that mccarthy investigated hollywood as head of huac the truth being that mccarthy was never even a member of huac and he had little interest in the politics of hollywood types his investigations were confined almost exclusively to arms of the us government the mythology about the red scare being baseless is now completely exploded by recently opened soviet and us government documents if anything mccarthy and co underestimated the sheer scale of soviet and fellow traveller infiltration in the us but decades of public misinformation about this period will be hard to correct one day maybe some really brave hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many american men and women clandestinely aided the mass murderer stalin and worked to impose his vicious system of government on the western world giving an accurate account maybe of joe mccarthy s career but i won t hold my breath till then we have this mythical drunken lying scoundrel of popular imagination so familiar in the media tail gunner joe ,0
my take on the ending bobby died at the hands of his step father mike had tried as he may to get bobby out only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly bobby died mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind on how bobby left mike made a plane that flew bobby out children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive was also great seeing my old housing area we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses not studios it was my kitchen bedroom and living room and those hills we use to hike them as kids looking down on our little valley seeing glimpses of the bay was a real nostalgia trip for me ,1
i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad it s 4 3 aspect ratio film and it just keeps getting worse the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable i was like watching the movie and said to myself this going to happen next and guess what happened right if you want to see a good action boxing movie don t watch this one you ll end disappointed on this low budget movie like i did go and see ali its way better ,0
with harry callahan getting up in years the inevitable old man with a chip on his shoulder story had to come into play eventually callahan looking fragile sometimes and out of place his demeanor still was unwavering thankfully this film took some time off to develop a different type of story one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre while the film fell short in doing so it was still an excellent addition to the series even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music ,1
movie about two australian girls debbie nell schofield and sue sue knight and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981 technically i was still a teenager i was 19 so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted script wise there s nothing new here it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating sex suicide etc etc i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored what i found interesting was despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair these teenagers aren t much different than american teens they had many of the same difficulties and hang ups also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and i heard it was a faithful adaptation of it the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well made and pretty interesting so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it s like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids i give it a 7 ,1
this sleek sexy movie is a must see only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent no subject left untouched style of narration the introduction grips you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really connect with internal horror this film exhibits the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography it surely defines the word masterpiece ,0
i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible i ve been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try le dernier combat there have been very few movies that i couldn t even manage to finish and this was one of them absolute dribble ,0
this game is one of the best rpg fist it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack you can transform into dragoon the special attack the magic the script is very good characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support as happened in several games of final fintasy series i got bored of that dialogs about past when you just want to go on with the game s story ambientation is a jewel on this game it combines middle age fantasy with futuristic science fiction it s remarkable that animation effects are just incredible i like them more than other in other modern games we can t remember that legend of the dragoon is 8 years now then map is huge there are all kinds of places an enemies finally music is not the best game muse i have heard but it s perfect for a game like this ,1
this movie features a gorgeous brunette named danielle petty she has stunning green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive she may not have a future as an actress because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it it is not a good horror film or a good fake journalistic report or remotely well done there is no skill apparent in it s production it is like a bad student film the story s horrific elements do not make you sick it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick i would give this movie zero stars if i could ,0

this is one of my all time favourite films its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest i always throw on this film if i m going on holiday or if i don t want to go to the gym just seeing nikki s gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be everyones cup of tea but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy romance and an interesting plot you will love it it is filled with great characters and ben and nikki are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing bottom line you have to give it a try i watched it on tv one day by fluke and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday my father the hero i love you ,1

after watching this movie i couldn t help but notice the parallels between it and another film called america 3000 both were very bad mid 1980 s post apocalypse disasters on celluloid obviously fake sets wooden acting and stupid monsters are found in both films about the only difference between the two is that the lead villainess here played by angelika jager has a very thick accent avoid this one unless you re watching the mst3k version joel and the bots barely salvage this turkey ,0
well i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it and i wish i had i actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day and it made me yearn for more of the same what i got was airplane on crack i mean if you like airplane or any other leslie nielsen vehicles then you ll probably be in heaven but if your used to the usually wayans comedy then you will be dissapointed there was alot more eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out i enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder and part one 5 times as much odd that the better of the 3 is part 2 but then again i always liked halloween 2 better then the original as well maybe its just me the funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye but that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on video tape and then rent it dont buy it ,0
oh how awfully this movie is i don t know if it is a horror film or a drama cause the story and the both genres are not established very well the story is not moving it is slow boring and sleepy from the beginning to end this movie really bores me but i really liked the camera work it is authentic fresh and clear the acting is great too the little boy was the great performer in this movie but it hasn t made me to jump from my seat but this movie makes me grab a pillow lay on the bed and sleep until the credits roll boring not worth watching i tell you this movie sucked 1 10,0

surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself this film shows remarkable story structure it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ one round jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack his girl and the professional boxer the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men this time for the heavyweight crown even in this early film hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement an armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness the only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 the final match as a result ends up being somewhat anticlimactic the story though is what carries this film through ,1
a train holding union soldiers is transporting 300 000 of gold along with a banker clayton who s there to see it reaches its destination but it s suddenly robbed by the bandit monetero however bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it but when monetero tries to get it out of him he s killed by soldiers the only clue is that of a medallion but monetero is captured and soon would be executed a stranger dressed up as a priest comes by who after the bounty of monetero and offers to save his life for half of the gold in exchange monetero gives him half of the medallion but clayton notices it and discovers something is up soon all three are crossing each other for the gold but also the bank s insurance company and monetero s gang are watching on waiting for their chance to pounce just watching the opening sequence you ll know you re in for a spaghetti western with a tongue in cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references some nicely realised from other films largely the dollar trilogy of its sub genre director enzo castellari s sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight but there s potential in many of his grand showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace largely there s a lot of tussles fist fights and plenty of acrobatic stunts taking place compared with all out vicious shootouts however most of these stunts are very well done and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there s energy to burn the traditional story sticks close to conventional details but since there s a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on the spontaneous nature makes sure you re never quite certain how it s eventually going to play out between the three this leads up to many effective suspenseful moments clever twists and plenty of wink wink the humour within the starch script is pretty sly worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style is giovanni bergamini s dynamically taut framing and francesco de masi s impulsively rousing music score the performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport george hilton s wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger gilbert roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable mexican bandit monetero edd byrnes gives a poised performance as clayton that holds up well kareen o hara doesn t get much to do but is a worthy looker gerard herter pedro sanchez and ivano staccioli provide able support a fun and worthy spaghetti parody homage that throws one curve ball after another and many fruitful down n dirty antics ,1
lynch the man has some really great stuff he knows how to disturb us then reward us by getting us think in different ways this however is altogether different dumbland s reward is 1 absurd comedy earned by enduring 99 stupidity i may have laughed once but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast forward didn t miss a thing i felt relieved when it ended and that s part of the point with this series it s an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations rounded out with annoying animation voices and sound but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile ,0
goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised it isn t completely faithful to the book but does it have to be no not at all john thaw is mesmerising as tom oakley his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol after inspector morse this is thaw s finest hour he was matched earnestly by a young nick robinson who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother the script and music made it worth the buy and you also see thaw playing the organ amazing the most moving scene was willie finding out about zak s death and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina buy this you ll love it 10 10 bethany cox,1
going down to south park is a 1hr long documentary about south park with interviews with trey parker and matt stone and all the other people who work on south park there really isn t much to say it shows the history of south park and what it takes to make one episode it is basically a behind the scenes of the show it shows the different merchandise that south park has made it was really comedy central who put it out it also shows the controversy which was caused by south park it shows plenty of funny clips from the show as well it s a fairly funny documentary any fan of south park should check this out you can find it on youtube 9 10,1
i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was i wrong the plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess however i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the asian boy says i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f stereotypes please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates,0
entertainment tonight has been going down hill for the last few years but as of last night aug 17th 2006 they reached a new low in an effort to try to hype up their broadcast they decided to post actual photos of jonbenet ramsey s body in their teasers last night saying pictures from the case you have never seen before the two photos were graphic and very disturbing one was of the side of her face and head neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck and bruising on her face this was so hideously awful i could not believe it how has this got to do with anything remotely related to hollywood entertainment nothing they have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low and it shows this used to be the premiere show to watch and it s just garbage now i will watch access hollywood from now on ,0
i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children s adventure movie the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed if you haven t seen this film yet then simply don t let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half spoiler alert the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man we had already seen him in the road warrior where he had helped max and yet when he reappears in thunderdome it looks like the two had never met whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors gyro man i do not know however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film 2 out of 10 doesn t get a 1 10 because of the thunderdome fight ,0
i caught 2 37 at the afi fest in los angeles it s a very well shot first film though the dv format begins to show itself in outside scenes and i m sure it has good intentions of showing us the dark side of high school in other words every side of high school but the filmmaker doesn t have the talent to write or direct up to the premise s promise there are several characters but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be there s no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of i am troubled teen x i have y problem the perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome let s start with the men you have the stoner kid who s gay the jock who s also gay the boy who rapes his sister and mr peepants as the stereotype requires all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves naturally or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes the two gay male characters beat up women peepants and themselves i d be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads or if the characters somehow transcended them yet neither took place and that s all there is to these characters stories next the ladies one young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife another is the pregnant rapee of the sister raping brother and there s the girl who kills herself i ll get to that later again i don t think there s a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers i d be out of a job were that the case but i do think that it s only justified if there s more to that character or story if that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than i m a teenager and life sucks i d be happy as a clam but nothing new is revealed nothing is subverted or changed or sublimated finally the girl who kills herself this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling we re supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we ve seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film we ve followed all these other stories for an hour and a half and now we re invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn t part of the story it s cheap exploitative and sloppy despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this you have to earn something like that you can t simply purchase it on credit so this suicide happens we get wrap ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down and the film ends what have i learned i already knew high school sucked been there done that i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women i already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked what else is there then smoke mirrors and some really nice views of leaves oh and the nastiest deus ex machina i ve seen in a while ,0
has the drama suspense and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains as well as educates the writers know their material and it shows the direction is always engaging and not blase and the acting terrific why this show didn t win any awards tells me the powers that be in hollyweird don t know drama or much else for that matter there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out i m glad it wasn t used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull rent this series at once let s hope its brought back from celluloid extinction ,1
if you want to truly experience the magic of don dohler then check out alien factor or maybe fiend but not this alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it s fairly creepy but nightbeast which i guess is sort of an updating of alien factor is just plain dumb actors sleepwalk through their roles especially mr monotone sheriff and the monster is some dumb halloween mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative but kind of stupid looking critters from alien factor a spaceship crashes on earth and there s a critter inside of course who runs around vaporizing people and ripping off arms etc and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too until it gets shot out of his hand and that s really about it alien factor beats this mess hands down if you really want to see a good don dohler movie check that out instead and rip don dohler 12 2 06 ,0
what i loved about the on screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress christine horne chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise i haven t seen any of horne s previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 i can t wait to see it on the big screen again ,1
considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xy s creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced they focused too much on john doe which made the story far less intriguing i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell s performance because i found he didn t make a believable john doe an other problem was the police story it really felt like déjà vu and it wasn t a pleasant sensation it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch the episodic format i could already see the fillers coming one after an other so overall i was very disappointed by it and don t recommend it to anyone considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled in some way i have the impression that it missed its target developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity it s sad because there was potential like the people he met at the club the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct but i ll never know if it got better probably not because i don t plan to watch the next episode ,0
the only footage of zeppelin i ve seen prior to this dvd is the song remains the same movie from 1976 we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences so what of this dvd i didn t know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd when did this come out i thoughtfor some reason i thought that page wasn t a great live guitarist but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement there s white summer from 1970 10 minutes of guitar wizardry there s an acoustic set from 1975 bron y aur stomp has a brilliant finger picking improv section the in my time of dying and trampled underfoot performances also from 75 are breathtaking with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has demonic possessions of rawk the magic continues into the knebworth 1979 section the rendition of achillies last stand considering their various drug addled states just beggars belief a song of complex guitar overdubs page arranged it in a way that lets him just punk it out live the effect is totally mesmerising in the evening i never liked this on disc but it zings along here sick again great piece of sleaze rock the footage from knebworth is very interesting cutting between big screen various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effect plant is amazing throughout all the performances page despite being painfully thin looks like a six year old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert and makes infectious viewing one thing that puzzled me the black dog performance from 1973 sounds very camped up robert plant always did love a little mince and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous and would warrant an arrest nowadays all very different from the muscle bound kick a studio version i love this dvd it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain ,1
 the ballad of the sad café worked hard at its image but when it came down to crunch time it was left standing in its own self created dust one cannot image saying this out loud but if vanessa redgrave s amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood my hard earned dollars would have to go to redgrave her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi million dollar contracted persona redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard earned woman from the south to the average viewer this could be construed as annoying but as the film progressed it became her miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck it was redgrave s performance as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this film stand tall but not the tallest the others following her performance were needed but not stellar as we moved past the murky cliché image passed on by every set designer hired for the post depression south job the minor characters felt like poster board the image was needed to set the scene but the characters of the town had no other purpose take for example rod steiger s vision of some old wild spoken preacher his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off the beaten path town the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene stealing moment but due to the lacking direction it just seemed faded the most absurd of the two albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line is cork hubbard who plays amelia s cousin who shows up randomly one night his character is never quite defined he lacks true motive and his loyalties remain uncertain he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us the viewers to question his sanity and honesty can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue flicking your ears and punching your chest and head finally there is the other end of the absurd keith carradine callow s close ups of this tormented man build character but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder these were the characters as cliché southern as they were some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece and i cannot argue that they failed where ballad of the sad café failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative this film was about amelia and her need for other souls in her life the audience s level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining one couldn t help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart cork hubbard s character is never quite understood but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona fide café owner the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave is the man crazy or does he represent all of amelia s family i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynch esquire relationship that they had then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as amelia s love interest using the technique of a flashback within a flashback we see the two wed but never consummate their love which amelia s anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness why was amelia so angry why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave why was this even in the film with the lack of focus towards these characters s connection the eventual scenes between the two made no sense throw in cork s choice and it just gets completely discombobulated while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b i lost focus interest and my care for the characters plummeted when i didn t understand the ultimate question why overall the ballad of the sad café began with a bang but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker my emotional feel of this film swung up and down up and down and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia and while the other characters outside of the random steiger tried their best i just didn t quite understand who they were their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred i was apathetic director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery which allowed us to focus on amelia or carradine but nothing was explained or developed the film played out with anger discover happiness flashback anger anger anger fade out without the comparative connectors this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera it was a shame because sad café had the promise it just couldn t deliver grade ½ out of ,0

i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big mama s of day are under the age of 55 will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about he did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie ,1
for the most part michael is a disaster ten minutes of charm and ninety s worth of missteps travolta and macdowell do their best frequently rising above nora ephron s numbingly banal script but the film moves like a snail and even within its fantasy context the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime an apparent angel living on earth out of their sight someone forgot to tell romantic comedy maestro ephron that william hurt brilliant in so many other films is no tom hanks the movie s climax redefines the word contrived ephron may be shooting for heaven here but unfortunately michael is a long long ride through cinema heck ,0
i m amazed that the hospital has been so well received by the critics and the public i found it dreary visually ugly and generally meaningless after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes the film does improve relatively but it remains way too far fetched not to mention unfunny to be successful as a satire and has too little substance to succeed as a drama the film s uncertain tone is its biggest fault overshadowing even scott s terrific as usual performance ,0
sergio martino is a great director who has contributed a lot to italian genre cinema and as far as i am considered his gialli from the 1970s are the undisputed highlights in his impressive repertoire la coda dello scorpione aka the case of the scorpion s tale of 1971 is one of these impressive films martino has contributed to italian horror s most original sub genre and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere style and suspense my personal favorite of the martino films i ve seen so far is still the insanely brilliant your vice is a locked room and only i have the key of 1972 followed by torso 1973 and the strange vice of mrs wardh 1971 all of which i personally like even more than this one that s purely a matter of personal taste however as la coda dello scorpione is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of italian horror cinema and suspense in general the film which delivers tantalizing suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash insurance investigator peter lynch george hilton is assigned to verify the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man s wife soon after lynch begins to investigate a person is brutally killed which is just the beginning of a series of murders the case of the scorpion s tail excellently delivers all the elements a great giallo needs the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning the score by bruno nicolai is brilliant the plot is wonderfully convoluted and the killer s identity remains a mystery until the end regular giallo leading man george hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead sexy anita strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead the includes the great luigi pistilli one of the most brilliant regulars of italian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s and alberto de mendoza another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of italian cinema athens where most of the film takes place is actually a great setting for a giallo the atmosphere is constantly gripping and the photography great and bruno nicolai s ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense long story short la coda dello scorpione is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must see for any lover of the sub genre stylish suspenseful and great in all regards ,1
this movie came and went in the theaters due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn t well received it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america racism plot story higher learning is mostly centered around malik played by omar epps a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a stern professor played by laurence fishburne he befriends fudge ice cube as well as a gorgeous lady named deja tyra banks later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus remy play by michael rapaport is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus once they impose their views on him he becomes as racist as they are opinion higher learning is not without its flaws character development is scarce okay performances by omar epps tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads whose name i forgot busta rhymes doesn t fit in this movie at all plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché before this film so you know i didn t like that part of the film with kristy swanson other than that this movie wasn t half bad laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps even though i could do without the accent fudge was ice cube s best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy all in all it was one of john singleton s best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now cinema needs more movies like higher learning mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy 2 fast 2 furious and a very pointless remake of shaft ,1
as a gamer i can t say i like this film fact is i down right hate it i tried to watch it as open minded as possible but when it gets down to it it feels rather insulting to my social group to me there are several reasons why 1 the characters seem unnatural i ve met lots of players of all different walks of life i don t know any who act like any of the characters in the film it s like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people most gamers are rather social people some with rather active lives 2 the style doesn t work the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better while it is good looking i e cleanly put together it isn t very good 3 the dialogue feels forced unnatural it also seems to lack any real world context gamers swear i ll admit that but we don t have tourette s syndrome 4 the humor is lacking while self deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i ve encountered this is less self deprecation and more like toilet humor likewise a large part of gamer humor is full of in jokes and anecdotes not toilet humor most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes 5 the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy i don t mean rules but instead dynamics invariably this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers dorkness rising both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game the difference is gamers the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs the gamers where you can say something like huh i know a guy like that yep that s definitely like gary ,0
in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late this movie in and of itself is truly manna from heaven in what could best be described as a cute movie approximately 350 years of movie acting experience allright give or take 100 years joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit remorse and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo ny truly well positioned to take its place in the feel good movie genre this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart all while renewing your faith in mankind from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo ny to the final credits the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family anywhere yet somehow this particular gathering of family and family by association in a small non descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill if you ve never been to buffalo you ll leave the theater with thoughts of shuffling off for a visit shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint down to earth tone to the film which suits it just fine the quiet beauty of the queen city of the great lakes compliments rather than detracts from the tale that is being told if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country s second cities instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere the end results would be so much more believable great performances by shirley jones frank gorshin wendy malick jill eickenberry and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts hollywood s flavor of the week any time go see this movie you ve wandered in hollywood s desert for too long ,1
the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi s fate as an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga that s as poetical as i ll get when talking about azumi 2 death or love because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood driven assassin after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape but i won t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma by the way chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace this brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the death side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons to no one s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily in azumi 1 the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation i won t lie and i ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but i ll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2 the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece for what it s worth azumi 2 death or love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die trying ,0
having just seen walt disney s the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man ub iwerks the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one s off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short it does get a little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony ,1
i did not see this film in the theater i confess to an anti vinnie barbarino bias who the hell was john travolta to be making movies i remember the oscar broadcast that year with travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn t win how dare he when there were real actors in the running i m sorry john you should have won after catching this film on cable years ago i fell in love with the entire movie bud sissy uncle bob wes all wonderfully done i also confess to never passing it by when i channel surf i have to stop and watch over the years i ve learned to do most of the dialogue dance with my thumbs in my waistband and learned to appreciate travolta more the only disappointing thing to me was the oversight on the soundtrack of some of the music from urban cowboy looking for love defines the film but urban cowboy was chock full of classics that didn t make it to the soundtrack it should have been a double cd ,1
don t let the title trick you into watching this movie i read the title saw that it came on in the middle of the night and figured it was one of those soft porn movies this movie is bad if you like soft porn movies then i m sorry to say this isn t one there are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so ,0
this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time jose ferrer played the title character nemo he did the part justice and certainly looked the part but nowadays it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird s eye from the tv commercials or maybe it s the other way around his nemesis professor cunningham was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith he never seemed to get over his penguin days from batman although he doesn t do his penguin quack here he is without parallel as the maniacal professor only john colicos of battlestar galactica fame chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham but it must have been severe since the prof never missed a chance to try and scupper nemo and vice versa the effects were nothing special though prof cunningham s submarine was way better looking than nemo s it also had a crew of strange fish like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding however the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof cunningham s secret weapon the delta beam he was forever saying fire delta beam whereupon a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug truly priceless they don t make them like this anymore and perhaps just as well but like other series of this era for those who remember it it will always have an affectionate if cheddar covered place in our hearts ,0
bestselling writer george plimpton alan alda takes on an assignment for sports illustrated he is to go incognito to the detroit lions training camp and try out for a position as third string quarterback he is quickly found out by the team members featuring alex karras and mike lucci the entire team finds it amusing to cause stumbling blocks in the writer s determination to quarterback for a series in a real game this movie is alda s debut and also helped karras leave the gridiron for acting besides the 1968 detroit lions the cast also includes sugar ray robinson roy schieder and lauren hutton alex march directs this story based on plimton s book ,0
this movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain it might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his her mother in a crowded discotheque full of people half her age inventing some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be hip in the parlance of that age to see ingrid bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch i was embarrassed to make matters worse the music in the disco was not realistic at all it is the bogus idea of some hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time that is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era the ersatz music is canned and bears only a painful passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60 s mathau is hopelessly miscast as some kind of ladies man he just looks lecherously grotesque hawn s wide eyed innocence is just too silly the handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too earnestly and seriously he seems like a brady kid who got lost in this farce painful pitiful mess ,0
a throwback to the old fashioned westerns of the 30s and 40s such as dodge city dallas has a number of things going for it gary cooper at his coolest blazing technicolor photography by ernest haller gone with the wind and a pulse pounding max steiner king kong gwtw dodge city et al score in addition there is a masquerade mistaken identity a faked death and more hair breath escapes than a republic serial as always cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure forget the 50s angst western this is pure entertainment ,1
the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty check on the dinosaurs keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this also keep in mind it s a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he s supposed to trust is evil and doesn t like him but he s still like yeah okay that just defined the stupidity in this movie one melissa brasselle proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies i can go ride a mountain bike between them but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far there s no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him but they have to stick to the formula of course and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like one of the army guys in this one how low can your acting career go the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying studio 3 to get into the frame it s not even honest pulp it s all taken from carnosaur which even sucked all by itself and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie ,0
did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad you d think some 12 year old wanna be made the film most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really well the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved that s not the case turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didn t even have any money good thing i didn t rent the movie myself ,0
first off i have to say acting isn t very good miranda cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly spencer her brother is a way much better actor spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but sorry it just isn t good sam doesn t even get credit i mean come on icarly pretty self centered eh freddy isn t bad i don t have a comment i must add that carly and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast they go shouting out all their lines it s sorta bad influence in a way because carly has a web show and if kids will copy this they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining at least this show isn t boring it has nice plots pretty strong many kids will like this because they don t look for flaws overall this is a bad show but it s not boring ,0

when i played the first soul calibur on dreamcast i thought it was great when i played the second i was hooked and finally when soul calibur iii was released i bought a playstation 2 and the game this can really keep you up for hours with a huge amount of characters loads of unlockable content and not to mention a great fighting system this really is the greatest fighting game to date the games strong points is foremost the vs gameplay were two human players battle each other either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and customized character the create character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations the only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style grieve edge only kicks has to wear those ridiculous shoes this is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for now i m just hoping the planned movie won t be crap ,1
ocean s 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on like a celebrity awards presentation each major actor actress is introduced in short 60 second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking applaud now sign the first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed poorly edited and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing speaking of the story there is one kinda but its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos only matt damon seemed to actually act during this film the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat pack wanna be session as for the heist the action the drama it was put into the last 8 10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic horrible horrible horrible ,0
the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz s most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i ve ever seen the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives like i said this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children in fact i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla that alone should tell you what to expect here ,1
now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and allan jones but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter yearsjones and martin sing beautifully though the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers jones s john ramsay is a frail character very similar to gaylord ravenal in showboat who jones also played as for mary martin it s a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one she performed well but movie audiences didn t take to her the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet there s also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles sakall would have been a good victor herbert sakall as irish hello nice movie but the real vic would have been so much better ,1
being a fan of movies like fire sale where s poppa airplane i saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned well wrong conclusion not only is this not funny it makes you angry because it isn t bad in a schlocky likable way but in a really bad way it s bad bad the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you re trying to entertain your audience with humour adam arkin s speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie still this cruelty of nature doesn t prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story if you can find one ed mcmahon i had to think of jay leno another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor well i ve seen a few leno movies and he s laurence olivier compared to mcmahon kenneth mars is good though in the few lines that he s given i m not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasi jokes every 5 minutes or so the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over he literally does starting 75 minutes into the movie he s in every scene but it s too little too late when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you re supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that haven t prepared for an exam in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an f but please don t assume i m a teacher that is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molester if you actually look for a likable schlocky horror scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try man with the screaming brain by bruce campbell or watch sunshine core if you prefer modern loud shallow scifi schlock those are equally funny albeit involuntarily ,0

gillian anderson is an arrogant driven career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun after a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked after recovering and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers their thoughts turn to that of revenge i thought straightheads was terrible violent brutal misogynistic and unpleasant if i didn t dislike the phrase a great deal i would call straightheads a video nasty certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980 s frankly i don t know how straightheads got a cinema release i am not a prude i don t mind sex and violence in the movies but they have to be married to a movie with a a good plot or b good characterisation or c preferably both straightheads had neither no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid luckily straightheads went nowhere fast it was only 80 minutes long it was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting film here with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third how often do i say this but it could have been good if it had been done properly what a shame i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film she especially is very underrated and is still particularly fit if you want to see a good british revenge movie rent or buy shane meadows dead man s shoes it is a little masterpiece last weekend i should have seen his this is england instead ce sera sera ,0
to put in simple words or rather a word would be best suited by pathetic the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot but but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall it seems like watching a movie from 1960 s where colors were dull directed by a debutant and acted by high school students movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not so great indian movie her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery overall i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch then try watching it at home when some tv channel airs it believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors and better carry a aspirin u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel p s i have no clue if the other reviewers even watched the movie i did and wasted my 10 on the ticket ,0
strangeland seems to have a love hate relationship with many of its viewers i personally loved the movie and everything about it the acting in some places could be improved upon but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can t in some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late 90s over all dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i ve ever seen it plays on the fears of many age groups adult parents and children every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet and it does happen in the real world and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will that happens too in the real world which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many my only warning is if you know you are sensitive to things such as strong violence visible torture and gore then you do not want to see this movie if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you then read as many reviews as you can ask people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed ,1
the story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excellent platform for character studies if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideon s simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant ,0
top gun without the in house animosity or class or money or cruise an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next big thing actors to market their ability to lead a matinée this doesn t really have anything anyone can get their teeth into it s a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece barking dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine particularly the action sequences michael biehn is a first class action hero but not a leading man charlie sheen is to all intents and purposes the leading man but never quite an action hero there s a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy 3 10,0
we expected something great when we went to see this bomb it is basically a broadway play put on film the music is plain terrible there isn t one memorable song in the movie heard any hits from this movie you won t because there aren t any some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back if they were good songs well but they suck the pace is slow terrible character development the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song it was almost impossible to stand this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die hard broadway enthusiasts this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i ve seen in my entire life a complete waist of time and money there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover who wasn t on screen enough and whose character wasn t developed enough rent the video and you ll agree this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do ,0
paul rudnick jeffrey addams family values wrote this frothy tale of a mild mannered school teacher kevin kline who is outted on the academy awards by a former student turned actor matt dillon the rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup the effect on the town his fiancee joan cusack himself and climaxes with an everybody loves everybody finale if you re an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man s struggle to come out or a true depiction of gay life then save yourself the trouble and rent something else maybe beautiful thing or read a book giovanni s room if you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of tom hanks s speech on the academy awards when he won for philadelphia and pokes fun at hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for 30 s screwball comedy bringing up baby holiday the palm beach story then enjoy far from being a biting satire the film tries for the exuberance of a preston sturges farce and comes damn close no it s not deep or powerful neither were romy michelle 9 to 5 or young frankenstein and it doesn t pretend to be it keeps it s tongue firmly in cheek it gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale there s also a locker room scene that could have been cut but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire it s like a breath of fresh air kevin kline and tom selleck are wonderfully game while debbie reynolds and wilford brimley add fine support the excellent joan cusack s award winning performance is stellar and the great bob newhart is well bob newhart the fact that many have been offended by in out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at personally i was more offended by philadelphia i ll take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime ,1
i m just throwing in this review to show that i m not crazy i like a lot of wynorski s work deathstalker 2 chopping mall against the law are fast paced and highly enjoyable just to prove i m not blind i have to mention this along with some shannon tweed body chemistry 3 or 4 or something are the lousy ones i ve got nothing against drawn out sex sequences but julie strain s breasts are so unnatural looking you can t help but stare at them which may be the desired effect but i didn t enjoy staring at them and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested the erotic thriller was the worst thing to happen to low budget flicks ever and thank god that their day has more or less done ,0
the one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel was i would never get the time i used to watch this back again if you want to see stacey keach and michael dorn try and earn what must have been then the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned wooden acting poor special effects the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie the opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment nicole eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds whilst the police military and joe public don t cotton on that the woman drinking coffee dosn t use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once she must obviously be from another planet just where i wish i was when this movie was on ,0
this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on this movie is practically mchale s navy for the 90s or police academy at sea grammer proves he can play roles other than frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the navy in order to get his own sub rob schneider is as wormy as usual the same in every role he plays and lauren holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain ken hudson campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase the movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non predictable script that still surprises me every time i watch it many of the navy phrases and terms go over my head though but it s a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters ,1
this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared as in was it as stupid as revolver i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose within the first 10 minutes he s given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy of soprano s fame which makes no sense at all then there s some shooting and then there s ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs then there s some animation ray liotta s naked butt lots of shooting teeth gnashing art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta s embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing which i m not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for not 5 times anyway everyone in this movie thinks they re smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he s yogi bear incarnate the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it ,0
this series is vastly underrated like many others i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense romance wit and of course sci fi right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero and every alien with whom he comes in contact speaks english okay a few others have skirted the issue but farscape did it the best the point is the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible with so much bad programming out there it s a shame that balanced entertaining series such as farscape don t get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production while we enjoy the four seasons and thankfully the four hour miniseries maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show ,1
ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes directs and stars in vampire assassins derek washington hall is your clichéd cop on a mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer no not buffy to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave vampire assassins is a horrible film it rips off so many other films can you say blade that it never even attempts to establish it s own identity the script is non existent the action is horrible who says a micro budget stimulates creativity there is nothing even remotely interesting here you will get nothing out of this except a headache stay away at all costs ,0
when i first heard that the subject matter for checking out was a self orchestrated suicide party my first thought was how morbid tasteless and then a comedy on top of that i was skeptical but i was dead wrong i totally loved it the cast the funny one liners and especially the surprise ending suicide is a delicate issue but it was handled very well comical yes but tender where it needed to be checking out also deals with other common issues that i believe a lot of families can relate with and it does with tact and humor i highly recommend checking out a must see i look forward to its release to the public ,1
watching josh kornbluth act in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class where the not funny had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed the delivery is painfully bad ouch the writing is simply dorkish it is akin to a bob saget show watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit post belushi i hated this movie and want my money back ,0
this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i ve ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had i don t care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guys that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric kelso donna jackie fez hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the best 10 10 ,1
pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television truly addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways ,1
the over heated plot of bonjour tristesse is taken from a juvenile first novel by francoise sagan which became a best seller though god knows why for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step parent it may have a certain appeal don t be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step mother in prospect unfortunately too much rests on the frail shoulders of jean seberg she s beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager the problem is that she can strike poses but she can t act anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto preminger s st joan seberg s first film knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film this movie also by preminger fulfills the promise of the first it was her second movie she was now 20 what was preminger thinking that niven and kerr could compensate for seberg s lack of acting capacity not a chance seberg s character is at the center of the story and pretty though she is convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old she can t meet the emotional demands of the role i don t know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check in spite of niven and kerr this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons ,0
wow i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage it s a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson a collection of musical vignettes and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids the vignettes are good especially speed demon but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment in which michael jackson turns into a car a robot and finally a spaceship and it s just as weird as it sounds joe pesci is hilarious and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout the real gem however is the incredible smooth criminal video which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone ,1
this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire ginger rogers film the plot outline dance numbers zippy music and the entire formula is there except for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a re pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual sidekicks for fred such as eric blore or edward everett horton burns and allen are used probably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but it s very brief and with a distant camera shot and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find gracie s idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full length films however in this film i must admit that they were great not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department now as for the rest of the film it s all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie not just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasn t a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint because of this the usual balance and great boy girl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid all because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bit it had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a point bringing my score for this film to 7 ,1
well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that s only because of all the bare breasted 70s painted up vampire witches dancing to the bongo drums this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them and for girl on girl action vampiric or not this movie just rocks ,1
poorly acted and poorly directed congo unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of jurassic park but the truth is the book wasn t all that great either still the movie s first problem is that tim curry s character was added the second problem is that the talking arm was added the main problem though is that the cast members don t create realistic characters i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth also starring laura linney happy birthday laura dylan walsh ernie hudson grant heslov joe don baker james karen and bruce campbell i m guessing that they don t wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes ,0
i loved this movie it is a definite inspirational movie it fills you with pride this movie is worth the rental or worth buying it should be in everyones home best movie i have seen in a long time it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear but in the end it gets better it is a story of romance drama action and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in i love a lot of the quotes i use them all the time they help keep me on task of what i want to do it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams all they have to do is work for it it is a long movie but every time i watch it i never notice that it is as long as it is i get so engrossed in it that it goes so quick i love this movie i watch it whenever i can ,1
although its plot is taken from the history of ancient rome caligula is not made in the style of sword and sandal epics like spartacus or gladiator that style of movie making was out of favour in the late seventies rather it more closely resembles a cross between a soft core porn movie and a video nasty at least the shortened 150 minute version does i have never seen the full 210 minute version but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page it would seem closer to a cross between a hard core porn movie and a video nasty as one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of penthouse there is much naked flesh to be seen and the film lovingly catalogues caligula s sexual perversions including his incestuous affair with his sister drusilla what is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes the obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence as though bob guccione gore vidal and tinto brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone it is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called brass and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called gore characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape the emperor caligula and his predecessor tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles so the film s concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate i do however question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in roman history both the fall of the roman empire and gladiator were set during the reign of commodus an emperor quite as cruel and licentious as caligula in neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of up pompeii emmanuelle and the texas chainsaw massacre and both those films are artistically far better than caligula the acting in the film is not particularly bad with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden teresa ann savoy as drusilla malcolm mcdowell makes a suitably insane caligula suitable that is in the context of this film the real caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill the great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished british actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production in the case of helen mirren the only dame of the british empire with a past as a porn star it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy but heaven alone knows what peter o toole and john gielgud thought they were doing unlike some other famous stage actors such as laurence olivier and richard burton gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of nerva a decent and honourable senator of the old school unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence whether brass and vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question the film does not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship even seen as erotica it is second rate 4 10,0
i ve seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it the conversations between nimi and her mother plus nimi and matthew are very touching the nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable luckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it ,1
late night on bbc1 was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress kelly reilly who is stunning to look at this is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don t know why you re laughing for me martin scorsese s after hours 1985 is the best example dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness i didn t spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised as a snapshot of the irish film industry in 2003 it all seems rather worthy it doesn t look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back the script could ve been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good i m glad i watched it flaws and all tho i don t think i learnt much about ireland today especially their policing methods ,1
this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention it s not going to win any oscars it s really not a very good movie at all heck it s not even really a movie just a string of short disgusting gross out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score gosh darn it i m going to give it a much better score the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say so i m not going to give some snobby critique of jackass s quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and commentates on how our society oh forget it what s to say there s no plot development no character development no real beginning there s a semi enjoyable end that s not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it and everything in between reeks of improper bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at it s actually pretty funny leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie jackass number two is just gross out crap that s really all it is i do give the filmmakers this though they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff you ll probably cringe several times throughout want to throw up a couple times wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomit defying stunts vomit crap urine semen virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in jackass number two there s nudity sexual humor abounds and so on and so forth it s entertaining if you re the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable then you will probably really like jackass number two i laughed several times like i said it s pretty imaginative stuff i never once wanted to vomit though i do have a pretty strong stomach just accept the movie s premise a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun once you get past that accepting it and going with it you ll enjoy it the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff there are several very imaginative very disturbing skits but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting towards the end things pick up but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film s quality in a half hour tv show this isn t a problem but with film length celluloid it s inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point after awhile the gross crap just becomes desensitizing on the whole though number two is an entertaining imaginative and above all disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain nausea and hilarity go see it if you must but hey if you know you don t like this kind of stuff don t bother you ll just be disappointed ,1
this is one of my favorite comedies ever not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero but taken for what it s worth and not as trivializing alcoholism the movie is simply a lot of fun it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune but only if he marries susan chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him arthur proposes but then unwisely falls for linda a waitress and petty thief dudley moore is perfect as arthur the world s most endearing drunk whose antics are a laugh a minute admittedly moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed liza minnelli sparkles as linda and her on screen chemistry with moore is great jill clayburgh plays susan the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur however this film is literally made by sir john gielgud who portrays arthur s sarcastic but moral butler hobson it s obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson s longtime employment hobson is arthur s best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur s romance at all but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant it s the butler you ll remember best long after the closing credits roll ,1
one of the few reasons to make these pointlss films is to give some actors a chance to hopefully star in better films if they re acting is any good the only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this there s 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jump young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines when one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die becoming zombies the adults in the mine stay dead no reasons are given as why the children become flesh eaters when still alive they looked terrified before the cave in innocent so they must become enraged at any adult which exploited them int he mines only reason that come to mind a mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine along with a land devoloper who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly what s going on yet no one believes him nothing new here you re usual clichés predictable a lot of negatives for this film very few positives ,0
other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cook s obviously coke fuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cook s spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupa s work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think you ll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time ,1
this was the first ewan mcgregor movie i ever saw outside of star wars since then i have become a very big ewan mcgregor fan but i still can t bring myself to forgive this movie s existence my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that i have been subjected to various of the classics emma being one of them i ve always considered them irritating stupid and boring however after watching this terrible rendition i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming ewan mcgregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of frank churchill gweneth paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama go see the originals if you re a ewan mcgregor fan believe me by skipping this film you haven t missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut ,0
another awful movie from hollywood this time a female helps the revolution in a central american country yeah yeah yeah hey lets make a movie without any sense of realism at all i am so sick of movies like this one the actors and actresses are lousy the effects are cheesy and the dialog horrible and suddenly i see john rhys davies as the evil president from gimli to hugo louis ramos i bet he is very proud of this well i shouldn t have expected much of this movie and i didn t and i am glad cause this sucks bigtime i wonder what kind of people who like this movie my guess is younger people aged 12 16 and i guess some people like because of kristin dattilo well i am in neither of those group and i hate it rating 2,0
time for a hit waqt dir vipul amrutlal shah cast amitabh bachchan akshay kumar priyanka chopra shefali shah rajpal yadav and boman irani written by aatish kapadia rating eureka we ve got it yes ladies and gentlemen in vipul shah s waqt we have probably found this year s first bona fide hit replete with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial bollywood fare waqt has all that it takes for a movie to click with the indian audiences it s the kinda film that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplate his next phoren visit in this saga of indian emotions then we have a happy family isn t it always of three ishwar amitabh bachchan the postman turned millionaire don t ask how there s something about selling toys while delivering letters and all that seriously who gives a damn married to sumi shefali shah is a doting father to aditya akshay kumar ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son s careless attitude towards the responsibilities of life his love for aditya though results in his procrastination of the grave issue however when faced with a situation that will test his race against time ishwar has no alternative but to throw aditya out of the house hoping that the new predicament might make him more conscientious of his own life but this presumed solution becomes a problem in itself as the rift between the loving father son increases and the fences continue to grow you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story provides ample opportunities to infuse comedy and drama alike so pre interval you have the initially funny later annoying comedy track of boman irani and rajpal yadav and post interval there are the go for your kerchief moments between aby and akki writer aatish kapadia he also penned the original gujarati play aavjo vhala fari malishu on which the film is based does a good job of keeping the narrative fluid the dialogues tend to get inconsistent at times it doesn t help that songs appear like acne on a teenage face and mar the proceedings clearly a couple of numbers could ve been done away with on the directing front vipul shows that he possesses a natural flair for story telling waqt as well as his earlier debut effort aankhen manage to keep you interested till the last reel on a personal note the seesaw of emotions was a tad jerky for me but gauging from the audience reactions it was working to the hilt finally waqt is all about its performances which amount to one whole point in the overall rating amitabh bachchan is dependable as always his energy is visible and so is his age shefali pitches in a finely nuanced performance and matches the superstar at every step boman and rajpal bring the house down with their histrionics priyanka has little to do than fulfill the perfunctory role of a heroine when it all boils down though waqt is akshay s vehicle i have always maintained that akki is as good as the role suits him put him in a mujhse shaadi karogi and he s fantastic but in a bewafaa he is woefully bad here akki is probably at his best whether it is his comic timing or his emotional renderings he is near perfect there s also an action scene for his fans ironically his previous best endeavour was in aankhen with the same director and big b at his side waqt is by no means a memorable movie it s not one that will feature in the better films of our industry but it is one for the masses and at a time when the industry is waiting desperately for a universal hit waqt might just do the trick abhishek bandekartrivia this is akshay kumar s second consecutive film after bewafaa in which he performs on stage during the climax rating poor average good very good excellent22nd april 2005,1
another one for the babes bullets crowd the story is much edgier than any other musical i have seen cannons hidden up the missing legs of females and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale more effective than contemporary drama it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants in lue of leggage pretty remarkable if you consider the context despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90 of the surprises this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon rocket launcher hence no group shower scenes or thongs the hidden projectile launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back seemingly from nowhere in miike s dead or alive 1999 the torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original tomie 2000 or the harrowing flame thrower scene in sunny gets blue 1992 all testify to an almost third world cantinflas esquire influence in the contemporary japanese cinema of which i am at a loss to explain but cannot complain you won t see good quality movies of this essence made in hollywood its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill is all but laughable this is a true film and while its great in its entirety the ending is a brilliant if not unblatant rip off of certain sergio leon pictures involving cannons where legs should be and certainly is appropriate ,1
well i generally like iranian movies and after having seen 10 by kiarostami the night before i was expecting a great movie i was very disappointed this is by far the worst iranian film and one of the most boring asian movies i have ever seen if you have never seen a kiarostami movie before watch ten instead if you want some good iranian movies you may also try sib aka the apple this movie is divided in 5 parts and only the fourth featuring some funny ducks is worth watching if this is the first iranian movie you see you probably won t want to see any more i don t blame you but you will miss some great movies ,0
you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben afleck he plays drew johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing maude s husband arthur is hired to play duda the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation drew s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you can t buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene ,1
it s the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others success here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier dracula 1931 and frankenstein 1931 in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims even though shot at universal and at the bronson caves it s a poverty row feature it s not fair to compare it with those earlier more expensively made and superior films from the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff through the talky but well done opening sequence we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film unfortunately it doesn t happen that s the disappointment we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of dwight frye the overdone presence of maude eburne aunt gussie and the premise for lionel atwill dr von niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil robert frazier never made very clear do not watch the technicolor dr x 1932 which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter before watching this the way i did it s an oscar winner by comparison so watch this one first structurally the vampire bat still isn t that good it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy besides dr x and mystery of the wax museum both 1932 and co starring fay wray lionel atwill s most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in son of frankenstein 1939 and as moriarity in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon 1943 dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in dracula 1931 as the young lovers melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene but that s about it he can be seen in the old dark house 1932 and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in the most dangerous game 1930 then there s her 1933 classic screamer too bad more time money and rewrites weren t available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill fay wray and dwight frye sadly then this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4 ,0
i found my tape of this long forgotten show besides the theme song disco beaver from outer space this show is barely watchable you will be flipping through channels just like the couple flipping through the tv channels this is a parody of tv the beaver is cool the homosexual dracula the chick discussing her peria experiences and the lady with the overly big lips discussing homosexuality show us everything that is wrong with tv it is all bad just like the beaver from outer space who seems to be lost in this new world you will be too out of ,0
natalie wood portrays courtney patterson a polio disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair with her partner being attorney marcus simon played tepidly by wood s real life husband robert wagner the film is cut heavily but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits wagner to consistently somnambulate laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood who also proffers a fine soprano the script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of wagner s dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at wood which must be discouraging to an actress the progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this coupled with choppy editing leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing although largely undistinguished the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and following the sound of a closing door remains at the center while the camera s eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty more controlled direction would have allowed the performers even the limp wagner to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship as it was released there is for the most part an immense lack of commitment ,0
aussie shakespeare for 18 24 set with blood blood and more blood and good dose of nudity this will not be for every one on may levels to violent for some too cheap for most done on low budget they try and do there best but it only works sporadically and this macbeth just seem to be lacking its just not compelling although there is some good acting on the part of most you don t get into there heads especially mecbeths the best performance came from gary sweet and the strangest mick molly if your into shakespeare then see it but if you like your cheese mature you will love it it not a bad film but it not that good either sam peckenpah would of loved it that is if it was filmed as a western i was expecting a lot from this as i loved romper stomper but this is was a vacant effort ,0
mpaa rated r for violence language nudity and brief drug use quebec rating 13 canadian home video rating 18ai saw coonskin today this film is also known as bustin out and street fight after watching fritz the cat i wanted to see more of bashki s films i saw cool world and thought it was mediocre and i saw this when it was first released the film was very controversial it was considered racist and al sharpton wanted the film banned he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing the film was only released on vhs under the title street fight it is now considered a cult classic film and african american celebrities such as comedian richard pryor director spike lee and the rap group the wu tang clan are said to have enjoyed this film i personally thought fritz the cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well worth watching for bashki or blaxploitation film fans the film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film who framed roger rabbit i would have preferred it in full animation but whatever the film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison while the prisoners wait the older one tells a story of three men he knew the film then switches into animation format we see three black men who sold their house to this man they decide to make names for themselves in harlem so the leader a black rabbit kills a big player in harlem and he basically becomes a big shot the film moves on as the italian mafia want him out the mafia involves the godfather his three sons who are homosexual and an italian clown coonskin is an entertaining animated film that s worth checking out if you can find it ,1
it seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth watching the acting was flat and the story lacked depth there was too much reliance on camera work which had some high points i have to agree with the other negative comments i only wish i had read them before buying the dvd the film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand there could have been a lot more plot development with why there are homeless in moscow i e post soviet capitalism rampant drug usage i e increased heroin trafficking from afghanistan more development of why the resurgence of russian orthodoxy after the fall of the u s s r the archaeologists themselves or even more into the struggle against nihilism ,0
where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones after all he did serve for 17 years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering oh i forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most powerful nation on earth the film is happy to show shots of a young senator gore asking why a nasa scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper but fails to ask about the complicity of clinton gore in global warming probably too close to an election year or maybe it would hurt the chances for hillary in 08 either way he s a political coward and party man to the bitter end he offers no criticism of consumerism no criticism of capitalism no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time in the end this film was much more about mr gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces mr gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film shorten it call it what it really is ,0
antonio margheriti s danza macabra castle of blood is an eerie atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts it looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic vibe alan foster is an english journalist who pursues an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan poe poe bets foster that he can t spend one night in the abandoned mansion of poe s friend thomas blackwood accepting the wager foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins the film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me the crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable barbara steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter elisabeth blackwood castle of blood is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early 60 s a masterpiece ,1
it s a beautiful film the scenes are well pictured anne revere s dialogs are really well written and inspiring the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives and the things it teaches makes it great and wonderful mickey rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through lot of emotional turmoil as the film progresses elizabeth taylor looks very pretty her scenes in the film are inherently poetic the way camera follows her and the way the music make you feel make every scene of her ethereally beautiful this movie has great spirit and a beloved cherished classic angela lansbury is quite amusing in her role though unrecognizable if you have seen her in role of m in the manchurian candidate donald crisp has done his father s role full justice and the script provides him with ample stuff to justify his role its a very nice film and a must watch for family and children an evergreen christmas favorite ,1
although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910 s others don t quite make it examples like his new job and shanghaied come to mind and i would also the floorwalker in this category charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store and vice versa this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it and charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects stolen by other costumers there aren t many laughs in it except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator for the rest quite disappointing 4 10 ,0
this film has great acting great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are how you define yourself how you fit in whether you accept to play a role or break free there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects i want to comment on the formal setting of the film basically it s two people on a roof there is unity of place and time with 2 protagonists and the radio acting as the choir many directors have turned greek tragedies into film many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy but no director in my opinion has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting a masterpiece ,1
this show is terrible i cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains this is not entertaining improvisational acting it s just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene i have actually done improv work as an actor and this show is not improv what the audience is actually laughing at if they re actually laughing at this show at all it looks quite fake is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights the dumb completely unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at and if it s not part of the scene the actors will tell them that it s wrong i find this show is disgrace to the art and makes me cry for shows like whose line is it anyway which had great talent great improv games and on top of everything else didn t make me want to change the channel ,0
as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn t take acting too seriously i m always amused by those who treat it as great art this movie skewers the actor s craft mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the part of a lifetime by the neo nazi head of the secret service he plays it to the hilt gets the dictator s girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa and turns the tables on his captors beautifully lots of great shtick by the leads lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard and fun little cameos abound sammy davis jr makes light of himself jonathan winters plays a semi retired american businessman with something else going on and raul julia sonia braga and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional this is a dumb movie but it has lots of beautiful locations in brazil a humorous script and good actors doing their thing and looking like they re actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play acting ,1
another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces especially the army for every disaster since the great flood anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is uniforms equipment sets and mannerisms are all wrong and of course all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years uses every cliche rumor and urban legend from the gulf all are presented as gospel the truth is no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses ps this is not new war is not fun and i know wwii korean and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments too and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem ,0
annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy i would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn t for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and it s too bad for hamill that he didn t take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo ,0
i couldn t believe that this movie dates from 2007 it had all the looks of a below average seventies horror flick didn t they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi didn t they know that in the post millennium the violence in a supposed horror and or scifi movie should at least be a little bit graphic or did i get the purpose wrong was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal bound together in the big cycle of life or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature or something like that it doesn t really matter either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts first of all the premise is very improbable if at a given time you re capable of replacing a total eye no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time that s totally unprofessional and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans and make the victim look like a freak by the way i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy like normal dark eyes couldn t they have waited for such a specimen the story is lame it s about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye transplants which suddenly makes him feel like the donor wolf or at least that s what i make of it and then he s being chased by some military men especially this last bit is ridiculous i mean i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment imagine soldiers with night vision eye sight but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient it s beyond me why they re out to kill him why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient a volunteering soldier maybe and why try to kill everyone else that s involved with poor aaron isn t that a bit steep who the hell are these militaries anyway i hope not the us army or the government they behave like psychopaths walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons raiding private apartments like they re after some public enemy 1 and displaying during the ultimate show down in the woods a total lack of discipline like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren panicking and shooting randomly around aaron for some unfathomable medical reason feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes why would that be he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves what is this are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor wolf are situated in it s eye balls and that the recipient of these eye balls also adopts the wolf s craving for red life meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all fours like a cat can a wolf even do that the acting or the lack thereof didn t help the credibility of all this either everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls especially this indian girl she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression vexed and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her but hey there probably had to be at least one love scene i really sympathized with actor cory monteith who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face but they didn t give him much to go with he has to run around bare chested for more than half of the movie which could have been fun to watch but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique monteith really should leave his shirt on his few killings and attacks are hardly shown we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there s another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest not much for a modern sci fi horror the only good acting came from justine bateman and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty something lady she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions but they made her character a kind of a wimp who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries what a pity that the script didn t make her stand up a bit more in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie hardly scary or thrilling with unbelievable goings on a lot of overlong national geographic like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes who cares some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments i guess the word superfluous covers it all ,0
well ok i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say i actually think this movie is good this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3 much like final stab was to scream 4 and well this movie isn t that bad i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick this movie is not half bad it has some scares and some really hot women i might add plus it shows off joey lawrence s new beefy look though obviously even that hasn t won him any big hollywood roles either i feel bad for the man he had such a career in the early and mid 90 s with blossom some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene but then like in a 360 degree turn his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one the movie also throws you off guard in it makes you think between the crew there really is a secret that someone knows to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret it also throws you off on who the killer is i had an idea but still woulnd t think the killer was who he was but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown now had there been a secret that was let out this movie could ve been one of the better b rated movies but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie a so so slasher flick good for a midnight movie ,0
this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it so if you re not a fan of dry humor dark humor or back handed humor you probably could find something else to do if you are however this is quirky with some nice twists and a flowing natural dialog the story itself is quite engaging not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes but close i mean that in the best way possible the intrigues are plenty the twists are enough to fully engage the senses and the characters are downright lovable i had a great time with this movie it rates an 8 3 10 from the fiend ,1
this is the second animatrix short and the first of them to be what one could call artistic it contains a lot of references metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes i ve heard some complaints that this is anti human or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine i don t think that s true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren t particularly accepting or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves i d say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical document recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but subtitled and worth a listen read there is also a well done and informative making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10,1

tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen not that there s much competition but anyway all in all tromeo and juliet is definitely one of troma s better movies one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung it s a funny action packed gory take on the world s greatest love story but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie well except for the ending where tromeo and juliet kill juliet s abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare s scripts thumbs up ,1
i saw bogard when it was released in the 70s it was one of those pictures that received an x rating for violence we snuck into our local grindhouse and saw it anyway pretty good picture lots of blood from the street fights although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it and lots of sex i remember one of the early scenes when bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him without saying a word he picks her up puts her in the windowsill and nails her from what i remember the picture sailed from that point on so when i found out bogart is also called black fist and was available on vhs i ordered it online i was very disappointed black fist is bogard edited for television so many of the scenes i remember were missing i wondered if indeed this was the same picture ,0
lights of new york was the first all talking feature film there had been of course the jazz singer released in oct 1927 as the first feature film incorporating synchronized dialog however this film released in july 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history it had started out as a short but gradually more was tacked on until clocking in at 58 minutes it accidentally became the first all talking feature film it opened to a grind house run and to warner bros surprise made over a million dollars that was good money back in 1928 the plot is quite simple two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on broadway that fronts as a speak easy for the hawk a gangster when they learn the truth they can t afford to get out because the younger barber eddie has all of his mother s money tied up in the place kitty is the younger barber s girlfriend and gangster hawk wheeler oakman has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend gladys brockwell for a newer model chorus girl kitty helene costello a cop is killed while trying to stop the hawk s men from unloading a shipment of bootleg liquor and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie thus getting kitty for himself this early talkie is loads of fun for the enthusiast of these pioneering works sure the plot is elementary and the dialog stilted but there is something you don t see much of in early talkies background musical scoring vitaphone had originally been used for this very purpose and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with the dialog and there are singing and dancing numbers the scenes in hawk s nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before musical numbers there is even a wild eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watch vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static camera booths so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is simulated and cheaply the greenery looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of our town gladys brockwell as the hawk s castoff girlfriend delivers her lines with punch she s a real trooper considering what lines she has to deliver to the hawk so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck huh mixed metaphors anyone and then there are her final lines i ve lived and i ve loved and i ve lost did someone get paid to write this dialog brockwell was making a good success of her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films the evil sister in seventh heaven when a fatal car accident cut her career short then there is eugene palette the older of the two barbers in our story his frog voice natural delivery of lines and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a put upon family man businessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold in fact mr palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is released finally there is the question of where is that microphone hidden microphones were still stationary at this point and it s fun to figure out where they ve hidden it there is one famous scene though where everybody can pretty much figure it out hawk is in his office talking to his two henchman who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk about taking eddie for a ride if you watch this scene you d swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film it s front and center during the whole conversation the microphone is likely planted in the phone there is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound you have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but don t know how to make the same impression on a vitaphone camera booth and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as compactly as they did title cards or filling up films with endless chatter check this one out it is not boring moves fast and is loads of fun if you know what to look for and no i don t expect this one to ever be out on blu ray but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it ,1
this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham s short tales the first one is the verger which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can t read nor write so what does he do opens a tobacco shop of course the second is mr know all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until i heard the familiar introduction another 15 minute one and also very good it worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps that s because i was only 14 the last time afterall the 3rd one is nearly a let down almost an hour in length it simply drags it s not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really i hadn t missed a thing overall i give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively ,1
i was pleasantly surprised with this one it s actually quite interesting and engaging the cast is strong even dan cortese brooke shields has come into her own as an actress black and white must have really set her free cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character if marketed right could be a medium size hit ,0
lets start off by saying that jawani diwani is just a pathetic movie i agree with the last person who said i missed the joyride lol the jokes were just terrible performances were average something went terribly wrong with the film emraan totally deserved something better all celina jaitley did was expose hrishitta bhatt was ok emraan hashmi was ok too mann emraan hashmi is a desperate guy who wants to become famous therefore he uses radha and pretends he loves her only because her father is a music director and could help him become famous since the father obeys everything his daughter says one day mann and his friends go to goa to have some fun there he meets roma celina jaitley and totally falls for her looks and tries to flirt with her bla bla bla then that night roma cannot open the door to her room and mann decides to help her seeing that he cannot as well roma goes to ask for help while she is gone mann is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on her bed bla bla bla roma comes in and they have a one night stand however in that one night stand roma falls in love with him that morning they spot the underworld don mahesh who sees it all the don loves roma and couldn t stand what he saw he orders them to get married and being frightened mann obeys the order and merry s roma then their marriage news ends up in the newspaper mann is later finds out that he loves roma after they do a music video together he is now trapped between love and fame bla bla bla the movie is horrible the songs sini ne sini ne is fantastic the remix version is even better dil diwana is also great the title track is also awesome guys avoid watching this movie ,0
this extremely bargain basement blaxploitation kung fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable dvd label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc so that wasn t exactly a favorable herald several other titles were released in the same series like the black six the black gestapo and the black godfather and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70 s blaxploitation hype neither tnt jackson is a pretty lousy film completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate apparently roger corman never too embarrassed to make some easy money assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to rapidly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental kung fu movies and contemporary trendy blaxploitation flicks the result cirio h santiago and dick miller came up with was tnt jackson the tale of an arse whooping black babe traveling to hong kong in search of her missing brother she quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drug smugglers and swears to avenge him mrs jackson smoothly infiltrates into the underground and encounters macho pimps helpful undercover agents loads of vicious kung fu fighters only one thing s for sure they all want a piece of tnt s ravishing body in one way or another i sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more elementary than this but unfortunately all the other aspects suck too the battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged jeannie bell and the other poor suckers try really hard to stare menacingly and assume a tough position but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and stupidly leap across rooms the cinematography is horrid the soundtrack is vastly disappointing whatever happened to soul music the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior speaking of which jeannie bell is undeniably a beautiful woman but still she can t hold a candle to tamara dobson or pam grier there s only one really good and memorable scene in tnt jackson namely the famous hotel room battle where bell entirely naked except for panties repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some goons amusing scene i just haven t figured out yet whether it s thanks to the light switch ingenuity or bell s perfectly shaped breasts ,0
a wonderful film in the best scandinavian eldritch magic tradition with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face should be compulsory viewing for all politicians take your pick from privacy nuclear sustainability global climate change quality of life reminiscent of thoreaus walden but with modern twist and considerable humour i m not finnish although i ve travelled there and have good finnish friends but i found it totally accessible and also culturally informative ,1
i admit that i am a vampire addict i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten i was very impressed by the original john carpenter s vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first and it is not quite so dark but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else ,1
i enjoy the national anthem i enjoy the national anthem if for nothing else then just before the midnight news i imagine i m playing the cymbals in the band not as easy as you may think one two three four one two three four but then what so i have sympathy with the practising bass drum player in roy andersson s wonderful film patiently waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s cassette player the 70s motif seems to continue throughout with some classic soulless furniture moreover every scene has an eerie jade wash which emphasises the minute nuances of the subtlest of acting which brings me to jessika lundberg s outstanding purple boots boots which otherwise would have inspired a silk cult advertising campaign but then the difficult bit someone asked me what it was about well there is a scene where the opening line as i don t have that length in green brilliant straight out of a gary larson carton i can t say what it s about go see yourself ron plasmahmm larson sounds swedish viewed 15apr08 ,1
i don t pretend to be a huge asterix fan having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics but this was a superb movie all the same i only saw the english version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters brad garret as obelix and sean astin as justforkix especially the story itself was both interesting and truly funny especially the contradicting name endings all the viking names end in af while all the gaulish names of course end in ix with a little romance thrown in that i though enhanced the story even though it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clichés the plot is this the viking chief timandahaf is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied so he consults his wise man cryptograf whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs and cryptograf tells him that fear lends the villagers wings taking this literally timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the champion of fear an expedition that of course leads him to the gaulish village where asterix and obelix live the pair are currently very frustrated chief vitalstatistix s cowardly pacifist nephew justforkix has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man and the boy is making little to no progress when justforkix unwittingly confesses to being afraid of everything in the presence of the brainless viking olaf he is believed to be the champion of fear and is kidnapped asterix and obelix are sent by vitalstatistix to go rescue justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home ultimately this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clichés and at times defective dialogs i thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it wasn t true to the comic ,1
although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off geez hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic i kept wondering why the victim didn t start shouting none shall pass and it s only a flesh wound i ve had worse it was one of the funniest scenes i ve seen in the past year the gladiator demon was a stitch too between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film ,0
charles chic sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the leeds family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant he fought at bull run in the civil war and his patriotism runs high even after his son in law is beaten and one of his grandson s is kidnapped by the gang intimidating all the other members fear of his grandson s death is no excuse he says he wouldn t want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway the conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this oscar nominated story walter huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they don t back up their identification of the killer in court the rest of the cast including the sleazy killer ralph ince are all excellent and the film is snappily directed by william a wellman there s also good suspense as sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin ,1
in the early to mid 1970 s clifford irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes claiming to have spent months preparing for the book engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire when all of this turned out to be false irving was accused of perjury spent several years behind bars although always admitting his findings were accurate flash forward to 20001 several months prior to september 11th a book entitled forbidden love published in the u s as honor lost love and death in modern day jordan by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri a woman from jordan who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia due to the fact that dalia being from a devout muslim background was dating a christian man it like irving s biography on hughes was revealed as a potential hoax australian film maker anna broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was khouri s attempts to clear herself of the lie s over the time frame of 104 minutes the film attempts to reveal is norma khouri telling the truth or is she just a compulsive liar with an agenda vendetta of her own interview footage with those who know knew her including an ex husband her publisher and others tell their side of the story this is a toothsome well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties not rated but contains pervasive bad language a re enactment of the grisly murder scene played over a few times but nothing nearly as graphic disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic such as saw part 84 not a good choice for the little ones :P,1
i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedy s sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women i d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though ,1
this movie seems to start in the middle introduces peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper thin and or impenetrable back stories almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film the plot rambles and ultimately goes nowhere the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors it almost feels like there s a first half of this movie but it never got made we re told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over new york city and that central park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government we re presented with the evil corporation in eugenics but that s really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple power tripping minions the whole eugenics is bad double entendre is heavy handed and never really pans out here we re supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why so much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1 hour 40 minute fatalistic rationalization for rape on the ground breaking digitally animated world created here all i can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and believable results after spending the time to watch this film the most burning question left in my mind was so what ,0
ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott kevin spacey john heard cary elwes roslyn sanchez justin timberlake wait a minute justin timberlake and he s the star i should have known better than to rent edison force in fact i did know better but in a moment of absolute weakness i rented this stv when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv you know it s one of two things an indie or a dog as in sat on a shelf which this did and with good reason the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force and journalist timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them he is targeted for his efforts or maybe i should say for his horrible acting i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing just awful the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo you just know the director was not in control freeman is clearly slumming ,0
as much as i like big epic pictures i ll spare you the namedropping it s great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes films where the plot takes a backseat to the set pieces films where the dialogue isn t so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose there are hundreds of films that fit the bill but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones it s an update of the movie that shares its name it also shares that picture s ethos but not quite it s execution whatever was great about the original has been streamlined whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster see the pug ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors sixty succeeds the plot and much of the dialogue isn t much to write imdb about often you ll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections a lot of people found this annoying i find it raises a smile each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with cage jolie and duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that it s also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here the chemistry between good ol saint nick the stalwart see date of review and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments the villain is not even a little scary i ve seen chris eccleston play tough guy roles before so i know he can handle them but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action we know the heroes are going to succeed somehow we re just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating in fact i wouldn t have minded some fourth wall breaking winks at the camera it s just that kind of movie all this style and not so much substance something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so would be worthless if the action wasn t there and for the most part it is wonderfully so i ve noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast cut extreme close up shots to direct action these days i personally find this kind of thing exhausting i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time i ve been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life i mean his character clearly doesn t care and it shows the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish and fun way possible so yes this movie isn t an epic life affirming post 9 11 picture with obligatory social commentary effort the pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line but car movies rarely come better than this so if you hate cars why are you even reading these comments i d take it over the numerous iterations of the flaccid and the tedious guess the franchise any day 7 10,1
ah such an original title for a very shoddy film the dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match as a result i had no idea what was going on as i watched this mess unfold there are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end the aztec ceremony had me laughing i rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever the singing aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot some guy gets a face full of acid there s a lot of fighting you have no idea who any character is not that i really cared and it s a whole noir mess oh and the actual fight doesn t happen for awhile so during the movie feel free to get up take a nap take a trip you won t miss anything exciting ,0
the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea but this movie s actors are worst then ben s performance in pearl harbor porno s have better quality and better actors i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense the poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80 s sitcom shows and in the end it ll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house ,0
i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school and the film has stuck with me through the years it s not about the soundtrack or cinematography or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting it s about the educational purpose and the message behind that is the most important it s not a sin to have a child when you re a teenager and still in high school and it s not really a bad thing either but it is a problem tons of girls i knew are all having children now and i guess they never watched this great movie and if they did they clearly didn t get the message behind it all it s about not taking chances when you re in a sexual relationship any girl can get pregnant the first time it s not a myth you don t necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first this movie has a clear message behind it just say no ,1
the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show but as a movie it doesn t work in the same way don t get me wrong this is a very funny movie full of biting witty dialogue that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic story one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or it s embarrassing to watch when i say embarrassing i don t mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras but rather you ll wish they hadn t included it in the final cut one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended to the tune of this is how we do it whenever i watch the film i stop the dvd when it says the end and leave it at that overall ali g indahouse is a good film worth watching a couple of times the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes however refinement is the key word here ali g is a better television programme borat is a better film ,1
oh man is this movie bad it flows horribly the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesn t love himself he tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue jim nabors seems as if he s sleepwalking not acting you ll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker loni anderson s hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didn t go out in the sixties or maybe that was a wig speaking of burt s wig wasn t bad in this film his worst wig day was in smokey and the bandit 2 anyhow this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with cannonball run 2 the original smokey and cannonball and hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films this one isn t even ned beatty who is a great actor stinks you ll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate and mind you this isn t one of those fun movies to bag on it s lousy pure and simple even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny and least i forget stroker ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt s coffin before his somewhat revival years later in boogie nights another film that like deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so ,0
this is a stereotype plot a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight the fights are not of high standards they are way too simple in a way that 1 1 is simple to every adult the fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking the coach yells do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once this results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movies and you ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes the fights are also shot poorly there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment these guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasn t up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they had a small budget i don t know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10 ,0
recap a lone swordsman living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen recollects how his life turned out to be as it is it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead causing him to leave his home town one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person comments i ve seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 how the two versions differ i can t say but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie a comprehensible story but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong therefore there are lots of colorful very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled much is left out in the scenes the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie thanks to these brutal but very few fights the movie is put into the action genre the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action the other couldn t be farther away from it the movie in its entirety is very slow dull and hence very boring not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie i might say that i m not a fan of this chinese style since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems most importantly that the visual is more important than the story but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i ve seen 3 10,0
the first time i saw this film i was in shock for days afterwards its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention helped by good acting and some really intriguing music the ending quite simply had me gasping first rate ,1
terrific movie if you did not watch yet you must watch geena davis and samuel l jackson are amazing in this movie great actors good story incredible action scenes the long kiss goodnight i give it a 10 a 4 stars ,1
i loved this movie so worth the long running time i need help with the ending though spoiler the final shot of marie at the end is this to suggest that she is still searching for renaud or possibly that she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13 she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to colin in the first place i don t quite understand it but i know i really liked it so if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it please elaborate on the ending thanks,1
i don t watch much porn but i love porn stars and i love gory movies so when i heard about a porn star gore movie i was really excited of course that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie i never thought i d actually get to see it but i did and i m not ashamed to admit i loved it even with all its flaws first the flaws the story is set in ireland and is called samhain but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland so why not just set it there and skip the third grade report about samhain irish immigrants halloween also it breaks its own rules by stating that you re safe on the trails but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere it s never clear how many cannibals we re dealing with there s a big stone castle that s obviously ancient yet no one s noticed it before the self conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met the ending makes no sense so what works the gore sure i would have liked more but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn t afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd i ve always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that ,1
i ve seen a great many films but in cold blood stands alone in a class by itself it excels in every department the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story rather than the name on the marquee blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place even inside the very house add additional chills the black white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent there are many outstanding cinematic works out there but if i could only vote for one to top the list it would most probably be in cold blood ,1
i ve often heard people express disappointment that mazursky s tempest has little to do with shakespeare s original in my opinion that is both true and false but most of all it s a bad starting point for offering critique a work of art should never be criticised for what it isn t but for what it is the movie tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to shakespeare s work in spirit what tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time no not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings mazursky s tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative cassavetes portrayal of philip prospero is in itself worth a 10 10 rating and when you add gena rowlands susan sarandon a wonderfully deep molly ringwald raul julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture i rest my case one of the best movies of the 80 s don t miss it ,1
looking backwards to that year 2002 when furia was made one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today s new generation in romania the main qualities of furia stand in a very solid script with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing plus a cast of excellent actors all four leading roles are admirably performed both with depth and casualness dragos bucur and andy vasluianu confirmed since then being two of our best performers today dorina chiriac follows them closely and adrian tuli a non professional in real life a graveyard manager cast as gabonu was a genuine revelation further radu muntean s directing is skilled and expressive creating in a very compelling style that feeling of a fateful night and inescapable destiny one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut never repeated in his subsequent movies hârtia va fi albasträ and boogie ,1
terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome here he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman naturally it s the woman below the sea her room mate lainie kazan soon winds up dead on the floor an aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome when a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene that s how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue her acting leads a lot to be desired martin gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him by the film s end you don t know why the girl was murdered don t even bother to ask ,0
the impossibly sexy rosie holotik plays charlotte beale a new nurse at one of those movie type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious dr masters anne macadams a k a annabelle weenick the inmates don t take too kindly to charlotte either part mystery part horror this initial effort from b movie director s f brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it these colorful psychos including a nymphomaniac with no self esteem a gentle giant who s already had a lobotomy and a supposed judge who speaks in legalese jargon dominate the screen with their unnerving presence it s a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality it builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another particularly effective is the poetry quoting dotty old mrs callingham for cheap 1970 s era cheese it s pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax i had a pretty good time watching it 7 10,1
what can i say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it well they loathe it this is the movie equivalent of marmite i personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made despite what many have stated i believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed it s fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself one of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view head as such i was always fond of the monkees especially the t v show back when it was repeated during the 80 s my mum had recorded head for me when it was shown on t v late night as she knew i liked them i watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until i was able to find a copy on dvd about 2 decades later what i would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece we can only hope ,1
starring jim carrey morgan freeman jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie i mean what a conceptual nightmare jim carrey playing god nothing is sacred anymore well this movie is hardly sacred but it also is not sacrilegious at least not to any great extent yes jim carrey has the powers of god for a while but he is not god confused i ll give you the low down jim carrey plays bruce nolan a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life he lives with his beautiful girlfriend grace anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground then bruce gets a shot at anchorman only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter obviously not please bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired much complaining and griping about god later bruce gets a page after a while he gets tired of it calling so he responds and goes to the omni presents building heh there he meets god freeman who is the boss electrician and janitor of the building i found this highly amusing god is the boss the holy spirit is the electrician and jesus christ is the janitor think about it boss obvious electrician the guy who keeps everything running janitor the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left brilliant anyway bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god he starts to believe a bit wonder why enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies since this is hollywood bruce obviously eventually smartens up learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done not bruce s since it is jim carrey the movie is quite amusing and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it the movie is not perfect theology but for hollywood it is definitely a good attempt many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie so while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it bottom line 3 5 out of 4 worth a view or two ,1
drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment some favorite parts of mine from this episode are mulder s dialogue in the car and the scene where scully goes in with the hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when mulder arrives the man is already dead 8 10,1
so your bairns are away on a sleep over the wife is visiting the mother in law you though are at home it s a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking so now what are you going to do i will tell you go make an old fashioned cocoa frys is best get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the dvd now go select and play arthur askeys world war two thriller horror the ghost train return to that comfortable settee and enjoy the night in the ghost train is a genuine british war time classic arthur askey with his side kick stinker murdoch entertain you and i suspect the cast to a high octane thrills and spills espionage thriller it s set in old rural england during the second world war it centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight through circumstances outside any ones control in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train the plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary the tale was written by that old boy godfrey of dads army fame and it is clever arthur askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast he also shows he can act a bit the cast are never out staged though even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer ,1
along with in the army this ranks as one of pauly shore s best movies if there is such a thing while the whole west coast meets midwest culture clash isn t anything new this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction the whole concept was rather entertaining not only was shore s interaction with the family hilarious it also had carla gugino and tiffani amber theissen she ll always have the amber in my book in two ravishing and early roles one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv ,1
i m in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst i ve seen in a long time i ve seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn t take itself too seriously but really i think that s a cover up for the fact that its horrible it s not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven t seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you ll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to cliché visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldn t even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you re going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don t let stunt folk act they can t also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it s not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld they re all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it s better than i could do of course i also know i can t make movies so i don t try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week i ve seen several thousand in the year i ve been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack ,0
i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l anglaise in this beautifully acted intellectually and visually compelling film thank you so much monsieur le directeur rohmer ,1
i ve seen this film at least 4 times since 84 and it s still great every time i see it it s a very compelling version of the opera carmen with amazing flamenco dancing bare bones sets and of course wonderful music this telling of carmen is a story within a story with each paralleling the other until the doubly tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production the film contains dancing by some of spain s premier flamenco dancers the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage makes the telling of the story even more powerful it s independent movie making at it s best and probably my all time favorite foreign film ,1
it s a weekend i ve been watched this funny film and i really like it all the kids are cute who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking it s a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night which could make lots of memories and laughters kid s humor always work nice acting as well simple story but cool shooting nice job for directer to find the kid s way when it comes to the kid movie i think of 12 and holding another one this year but differed aspect to the kid s world which is real and cruel awesome work h2efw focuses on the happy side of childhood which every kid and family need p s twitch i think is the voice of nemo from finding nemo ,1
film follows a bunch of students in the nyc high school of the performing arts there s coco irene cara a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything she s helped by bruno lee curren a white musician then there s doris maureen teefy who wants to be an actress but she s shy and scared she becomes friends with motgomery paul mccrane purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by raul barry miller then there s leroy gene anthony ray who sadly died in 2003 who s homeless and a great dancer but can t read then there s various teachers albert hague anne meara stand out trying to teach the kids the songs are great the title tune and out here on my own were nominated for best song fame won the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent but this film misses the boat in the drama department many plot lines are brought up and completely left open ended by the end of the movie why did coco do a porno did doris and raul remain together afterwords did either make it how about montgomery what happened to him and did leroy ever graduate and how there are too many long speeches raul has two and moments that just lead to nothing i m assuming there were cuts in the script i can t believe the movie just left all this open still it s worth seeing for the acting and again the music there s basically not one bad song and the dances go full force and at one point stop traffic literally my favorites are fame out here and i sing the body electric which is a great closing song so i recommend it but can only give it a 7 the script really needed to tie up loose ends and it didn t trivia they wanted to shot this film at the actual school for performing arts but couldn t get permission the dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film that is true there is a lot of foul language but that s how high school kids talk avoid the tv version which abysmally overdubs it ,1
this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never forgot it is certainly not the best movie ever made but there is something very special about it that i can t quite put my finger on i love it i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy exactly what who is that mysterious witch lady and what is her relationship with tom why and how did he become a water baby why was he raised on the earth it is questions like these that are just eating at me i thought if i read the book i would get answers but i just read an article that the book from which this story is based is a lot different so i guess i ll never know what the writer was thinking i still love this movie though and i recently watched it with my two year old niece she loves it too although she insists on calling it baby water for reasons unknown to me she loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares i m all clean you have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world we watched that scene over and over i am so glad that we can enjoy this film together there should be more films like this but what is up with the gay seahorse ,1
this is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads after all feierstein s flex crush will have you know that real men don t watch anything by truffaut it might have been interesting if truffaut had anything to say here the camera as voyeur motif was nothing new have we all forgotten de sica s bicycle thief or anything by hitchcock so all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as truffaut who spends all his free time screwing up his eyes at the movies who wrecks schoolroom discipline gets accused of plagiarism the many petty thefts and ultimately escapes societal confines to make his own movie sorry been there done that too many times for this to matter ,0
miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70s and it s only been recently that his movies have made it american shores via disney and fans fawning over his great talent ponyo is no exception although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to us audiences some may find this one a bit on the fence being sort of japanese in its presentation for the same reason pom poko is very japanese and doesn t make much sense to us audiences so too are some elements of ponyo this should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth hope and friendship what does come across well is miyazaki s very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy that coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters he steps out of his zone a bit with ponyo as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high seas although not lonely sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea similar to spirited away we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and i feel that miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are different i managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot miyazaki has claimed that this is my last movie for many years but shortly after spirited away he gave us howl s moving castle ponyo is certainly proof that miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight innovate and pioneer the most creative animated movies of all time watch ponyo with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and you ll be transported back to when catching fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring grown up stuff and eating your vegetables ,1
29 sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks this was the date that bbc1 broadcast for the only time i m aware of jeff lieberman s super creepy 1981 shocker just before dawn and it made a huge impression on me nearly twenty years later i m delighted to report that i ve finally got my hands on the two disc shriek show media blasters special edition and it s just as eerie and unsettling as i remember it if not more so the plot as is usual for genre flicks and this was lieberman s first film as a director for hire though he did at least remove all the religious cult snake handling mumbo jumbo from the screenplay is a bit thin five likable twenty somethings including chris lemmon son of jack in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides venture into the dense oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land that s been bequeathed to one of their number but just before dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because lieberman wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preacher s truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning the youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy winnebago blondie s heart of glass pounding on the soundtrack and before you can say texas chainsaw massacre they ve clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavy set maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes forest ranger roy george kennedy warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further but they go ahead with the trip anyway refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though he s understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere needless to say things go downhill from here although this film s not short on bloody horror and well handled action scenes the standout moments for me are those where lieberman lets his camera zoom out long and slow from apparently innocuous shots of the fun loving kids larking around in the wilderness or just lets it settle for a while on the dense imposing people dwarfing woodlands he makes the oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as kubrick made the overlook hotel s spacious interiors in the shining and brad fiedel s score discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles stays the right side of intrusive underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair there are plenty of surprises along the way nods to deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky disturbing family and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the film s end i won t spoil it for you i ve said enough quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come it deserves to be ,1
this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth in order to create a gay universe i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was still i was shocked at how bad it was it looked more like a film made 50 years ago the acting if any is ultra bad the sets and props are so ridiculously fake making any college film look mega budget and the special effects are laughably simple indeed jaw dropping as others have commented but jaw droppingly embarrassing one has to be severely intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film if i was from denmark i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film ,0
not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half way through but then with this one i was only 15 minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not it s not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual it s that it s not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead it s boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audible not that it s worth hearing though this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere ,0
this is one of those star filled over the top comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead unfortunately one night at mccool s is a classic b goldie hawn recently commented about town and country that it s a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also mangled it daily maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say it s the script stupid this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through they re working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre is it an unmitigated disaster not entirely there are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking eh it was okay so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review the ending if as it s been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly i really wish i could speak specifically about it but i hate people who give too much away even in warning suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent over paul reiser nothing given away here it s in the trailer get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking eh it was okay the rest of the movie is tacked on and creatively bankrupt and you ll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess if you loved there s something about mary or meet the parents both great movies then don t bother to see this movie go have those teeth taken care of instead ,0
i found the film quite expressive the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him his flatmate for example he was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again it was like a game character or pan man through a mine land or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive ,1
this show was a really good one in many ways although certainly an atypical western with the hero riding around on a motorcycle rather than a horse due to the 1914 setting very late for a western which tend usually to be set between 1866 and 1890 i remember some controversy about its cancellation at the time but didn t really watch it during its time on nbc when i came to see it and love it was a decade later when i was in the army stationed in germany and it was shown every week from the beginning on armed forces television by then margot kidder was famous as lois lane but i ll also always think of her as nichols girlfriend in a lot of ways nichols was a lot like maverick both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting it was in the little tv magazine that they distributed at the px not really an authorized edition of tv guide but made to resemble it as closely as possible without getting into copyright trouble that i first learned the real story behind the cancellation i really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really made it as planned of course by the time this show was made the western era of tv had been in decline for around a decade someday i hope to be able to write that the reality era has been in decline for that long while gunsmoke and bonanza were still running they were both nearing their ends and it had been years since a new western had really caught on i think that this trend did a lot to hold nichols back and was the main reason that nbc executives doubted that it would ever find a large audience but to me a good western unlike a show set in contemporary times is somewhat timeless as are other period shows changing fashions and the like do nothing to make them look any more dated than they were supposed to be and i think that watching this show 10 years after it was produced is really what brought this point home to me also this show is an early pairing of garner and stuart margolin who is really one of the all time great sidekicks and not just in westerns ,1
 ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many 50s movies about hot rodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens can t pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and there s a twist at the end there s nothing in this movie that you haven t seen in other movies but it s nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foul mouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didn t talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we don t expect out of a bird the movie s pure hokum but harmless ,0
although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school 1996 when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them their hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that still in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party not so unlike the one in jay s house which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd a world class bs er and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie i was also the one with a car although i had a little bit of madge s insecurities floating around in there too my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our annie watching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally had now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth though none of my friends died i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up ,1
being relatively young i didn t know how bad anti semitism was in brooklyn where my family is originally from this movie absolutely horrified me i ve seen many movies about prejudice racism and anti semitism but this seemed to hit me harder than most this was definitely one of the best indie films i ve ever seen i had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it nearly everything about the movie was great sometimes it was a little slow but that didn t really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric it took place in the 40s and it really did look like it was the 40s the acting was great william h macy as always was wonderful so was laura dern and i was pleasantly surprised by meatloaf s performance playing the vicious anti semite neighbor 9 10,1
except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad the cheap production values don t help of course you wouldn t really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn t keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with even for a b movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks ,0
oh my god it just doesn t get any worse than this i always love silly little sci fi b movies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released what were these people thinking they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do the acting and the not so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget b movies and what is with the men dressed up as women could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing no probably not i would give this a 0 if possible it does not even deserve a 1 for awful do not waste your time and especially not your money on this horrible loser of a non film ,0
featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid solo seven pounds races past the director s previous collaboration with the actor the pursuit of happiness a flick which i also loved remember gabriele muccino s name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn t quite so high profile too bad i figured out will smith s scheme early on i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson s character is introduced as having an incurable heart disease however i still think the writer director made the right choice putting the bookends bookends are the first and the last scene in that way it s the source of urgency and tension in the movie finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith s and dawson s character flourish and develop knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith s character could have a divine gift and i understand why his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones yet at other times he could be harsh and scary and when he s alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely it s quite a versatile performance lastly i can t forget to mention the crash scene re enactment which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music put this on your list ,1
the cinemascope color cinematography of leon shamroy is quite remarkable here including his use of colored filters forvarious scenes the alfred newmann score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced it s a shame it is no longer available on cd the actors however never rise to the occasion the accents are so varied from the subdued british of ustinov and purdom to the hollywood of baxter and mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision tommy rettig is jarringly american acting styles span the range from zombie like to stilted only ustinov as a conniving one eyed servant steals the show what there is of it to steal the premise the story of a young egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god ra persecuted by the authorities has its interesting points but when the film s plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain ,0
well well roeg touched a bit of a nerve there didn t he he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption or even some good advice might be found in the bad old catholic church the hipper than thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious worse still theresa russell s character faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level that of the spiritual you know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art house cinephiles are supposed to be above oh the horror so she finds her marriage the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives but they probably won t sure this film has some problems notably talia shire s delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s style attire and all and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations though hitchcock s movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst but sadly nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents ,1
why can t more directors these days create horror movies like the shining there s an easy answer to that modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved once and for all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time so the plot is fairly simple a man named jack torrance played brilliantly by jack nicholson and his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the off season the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i mean this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary it s some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubrick s movies 2001 a space oddysey and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesn t disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it finally i must comment on nicholson s legendary performance jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is top notch acting that must be seen to believe there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one r i p stanley ,1
a less than subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show throughout the show dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked especially if god is so good why does he allow evil to exist in the world diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version though some might disagree of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the company line and condemns half the world to burn in hell to celebrate her school s 25th anniversary she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant however when the quartet update their play to parody sister mary s fallacious teachings the nun is pushed over the edge sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts not recommended go watch the play instead ,0
this is the absolutely worst show in the history of nickelodeon first of all no boarding school has a sushi bar flat screen tvs and gives every student a laptop this makes the show so unrealistic and boring the plots are pointless and incredibly boring the actors are so bad it makes me want to take my own life i really hate the fact that in the show zoey is the most popular girl in school and the prettiest and smartest and gets the best grades without doing any work she never has any real problems and every guy wants to date her she is so perfect there isn t anyone like that also i hate that everyone would do anything for her and everyone picks her for every team or club it is so annoying quinn is so obnoxious her experiments are pathetic pointless and fake chase is such a wimp he says he loves zoey but if he told her it would ruin their friendship how pathetic michael tries to be funny but he never accomplishes anything nichole is so perky and screams a lot she is never seen doing any work or studying but she is a straight a student lola thinks she is an actress but she sucks excuse my language need i say more i think no for your own good stay away from this show at all costs ,0
i have seen all the film interpretations of hamlet from sir lawrence olivier to mel gibson gasp derek jacobi captures the true essence of the character from the beginning to the brutal climax superb acting all around this one should not be missed ,1
the only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance if you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another nicholas sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films such as message in a bottle nights at rodanthe and a walk to remember think again nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn t transform these characters if anything it makes them even more miserable than they were a soft spoken special forces army sergeant john tyree channing tatum of g i joe has a memorable two week fling while on leave from the military with an impressionable college girl savannah curtis radiant amanda seyfriend of mamma mia who is spending spring break in south carolina savannah doesn t drink smoke but she tells john that her head is filled with profanity inevitably john and savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep inducing by any standard tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class just as they are getting hot and heavy between them suicidal terrorists crash planes into the world trade center john reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with savannah meanwhile another guy shaggy but likable family friend tim henry thomas of e t the extra terrestrial who has a motherless autistic child named alan becomes the object of savannah s sentiment she is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children she delays what seems forever before she finally contacts tyree with the eponymous letter indeed she dumps him for a man with a disease later she confesses to john that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry tim so she doesn t make that fateful call predictably john agonizes over savannah s lack of communication during a routine mission our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in germany while all this is transpiring tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin collecting father mr tyree richard jenkins of step brothers who suffers from asperger s syndrome it seems that his father is on his last legs after john gets out of the hospital the lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of tyree amounts to a pretty low blow tyree his father and tyree s commander keith robinson are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance dear john gives new meaning to lethargic love stories yuck ,0
this has to be one of if not the greatest mob crime films of all time every thing about this movie is great the acting in this film is of true quality master p s acting skills make you actually believe he is italian the cinematography is excellent too probably the best ever this movie was great and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm ,0
i suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like search ufo and 6m man were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future adventure and technology you got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them the only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it they didn t get to take your show and add in their own comments over it i did not know what this concept of a pilot was i saw the movie and was hoping thru out that stryker would get home did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours back then would i understood what so many people hate about the movie now i doubt it because i don t remember it as such do i understand now not really for to understand the story one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie if one is watching as an american it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state but if one is a subject in that state then compliance could be expected and security can be less when things are suppose to be perfect perfect to an extreme degree perfect that one is not suppose to doubt then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order the subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power these days one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it so much of the suspense surprise is lost but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut s biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr one gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns this is the primary difference between the stranger and doppelganger the latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the ussr are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie in the former those links are through out the movie supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards all that said despite my fond memory for the movie it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series each week stryker would make friends benedict would chase stryker would get away eventually benedict s society would get rid of him someone else would pick up the chase a rut would develop there might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from stryker s mission showing up but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going if one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie odds are they will slash it as well but if one remembers that this was made during the cold war and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time of what the popular environment contained for the viewer then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it ,1
i just checked out northanger abbey from the local library and wasn t expecting much imagine my suprise at this gothic treat northanger abbey is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen with empty passageways and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets the glory of the movie is that it never reveals all your imagination runs free running with the imagination of the main character one kathrine m she is a girl of wild imaginations a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings into her and our real world if i were to use one word to describe this excellent movie it would be surrealistic dreams are woven throughout the movie enhancing the mood sometimes it is hard to tell what is real and what is not this is intentional i believe atmosphere reigns supreme the music is not what you d expect of a movie by jane austen it is eerie flute and drum based high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear if a soft pleasant tune were playing in northanger abbey it would be positively inviting now it is foreboding a grim and stark walled palace of madmen but the characters you shall have to see them for yourself if you are looking for a most enjoyable evening look no further than northanger abbey ,1
personnaly i really loved this movie and it particularly moved me the two main actors are giving us such great performances that at the end it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous and the song are just great the way they are that s why i didn t feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards the most rewarded movie at the golden globes an oscar and even a grammy this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone a great movie that has often been criticized maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it surely as a co director her artistry is the biggest and that will surely please you ,1
this film is a fine example of why the shaw brothers are among the finest directors probably the best in the kung fu category the movie is well paced the story is excellent and intriguing and while the humor may not be in your face it is nested within the character interactions once the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes tiger crane and crab hung gar are very present there is even a scene that mocks 18th century western social events and ends with clever and entertaining fighting the movie ends with a sudden cheesy moment but if you are a fan of the shaw brothers you ll understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the main course of the movie ,1
now this is one of big s best jack hulbert s single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all they re worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdoch the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between side splitting and ghastly dull when the formula works it s very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists thank any god britain hasn t got any nowadays ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you ll probably be very disappointed ,1
i purchased this film for 5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only chase masterson but i should have crumbled up the five thrown it in a toilet and flushed the film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died there problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one the acting is abysmal these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and dawsons creek the directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old the entire set looks like someone s backyard in malibu the people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and or actors avoid this pile of garbage at all costs ,0
hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries this movie has a cast that includes robert young randolph scott dean jagger and john carradine scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger s life jagger works for western union a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can t shoot a gun but can ride scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can t tell anyone it s a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns ,1
well i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother daughter relationship film beautiful film ,1

chokher bali a passion play based on rabindranath tagore s novel of the same name this is a classic tale of deception adultery and relationship exploitation set in 1900 bengal director rituparno ghosh transformed the nobel laureates acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat tagore s story elaborately deals with the bengali society through his central character the rebellious widow who wants to live a life of her own we are taken into the picturesque part of bengal where we meet our heroine the beautiful young widow binodini aishwarya rai despite her gorgeous looks two handsome men the rich mahindra prosenjit chatterji and his friend behari toto roychowdhury denied marrying her mahindra chooses a naive ashalata raima sen over binodini and marries her leaving behind the country life the free spirited binodini accompanies mahindra s mother to calcutta as a caretaker soon her friendship with ashalata flourishes it looks like the two addressing each other as chokher bali sand in the eyes share an enduring bond the english speaking binodini captures a special place in the house but soon she unmasks her real face manipulating good natured ashlata binodini gets closer with mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires when she is thrown out by the enraged mother of mahindra binodini seeks solace from a reluctant behari the remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax aishwarya walks through the role a manipulative rebellious lady still gaining the viewer s sympathy with a ballet dancer s elegance the other lead artistes prosenjit chatterjee raima sen and toto roychowdhury are equally brilliant in enacting their characters while tagore penned this mould breaking story at the turn of the 20th century the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo even among the upper class narrating the nations freedom movement in parallel the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life kudos to the art director who gave life to the early 20th century bengal and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve this passion play by tagore has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality ,1
i m not sure how i can make ten lines out of this question but i ll try when julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music what was the name of the song that was playing and who played it i love that song and i watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song i did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack but i sill can t find the song it might be because the song they were dancing to wasn t a complete song and just partial i would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it thank you frank,1
beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful elegiac work of art the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in makes you want to touch the screen the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience or to put it another way an old man i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo that is the dialogue doesn t really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for storylines forget it some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them don t bother if you want simple entertainment this not for you i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days but i won t if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film ,1
the running man is one of those films that if overwatched would become boring and depressing even my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary post 1980s boom forget that though there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film schwarzenegger is on top form as ben the butcher of bakersfield richards and the inclusion of bond belting one liners was completely inspired thety are truly leg end dary with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight the design of the stalkers is authentically american and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc gladiators tv show and the wwe as well buzz saw s grisly end will chill any viewer to the core as a foot note why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle and are arnies buds in real life and its even got mick fleetwood in it too what more could you ask for i highly recommend the running man if you re looking for a great piece of entertaining action with a glossty finish and some great characters just don t expect an education from it at least on surface value quality i bloody love it actually you will too unless you re a thesp 7 10,1
jet li is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world he has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame while he is big in asia he is almost unknown here in the us black mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him but it fails horribly first of all it is dubbed while it may have camp value the dubbing isn t even close and it is flat in tone it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer secondly the director in this movie daniel lee does a horrible job he cuts scenes so fast at times you don t know what s going on other times the camera shakes and wobbles fans see jet li s movies for the fantastic martial arts however the director edits the scenes so fast that you don t even know who s who half the time other times a scene is left hanging ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep while the badguys arm their guns two seconds later both li and the love interest are already under the car other scenes are so improbable that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous killer cd roms just give him throwing stars li needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise a scene the added rap techno music goes from being okay to intrusive the plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon because he has a half mask on wouldn t the hair lower jaw or voice give it away if you want to see a jet li movie try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple this disjointed mess is a complete waste of time 2 10,0
this film launched my theory about films based on books instead of following the cliche you ve read the book now see the film if you are looking for a good book to read try one upon which a movie you like was based because it ll be 10 times better i saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again it s a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors jon voight with what became my favorite book the water is wide by pat conroy i can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life two tiny caveats 1 the video suffers severely from pan and scan and deserves a letterbox version 2 the title should be restored to the name of the book a reference to one of the most touching enigmatic songs ever written:(,1
well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no ploteven then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold give the demonic 0 10 ,0
i agree that this film was spectacular the way in which jamie foxx captured not only the impression of ray charles but the essence of ray charles really made the film his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told i also found a great interview with jamie foxx about this role by ernie manouse from innerviews on kuht houston channel 8 the link is http video google com videoplay docid 3001837218936089620 q innerviews jamie foxx hl en i encourage everyone to check it out as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about ray charles the only problem i might cite with the film is that the shotting style was rather bland at times but in the end i think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person ray charles rather than the film ray ,1
it was once suggested by pauline kael never a fan that cassavetes thought not like a director but like an actor what kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker to take that comparison further to me it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film it feels like cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation like orson welles cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles but far more important as a true artist as opposed to a technician or rhetorician this is like a cross between italian passion though cassavetes was actually greek and scandinavian introversion never before have inner demons been so exposed physically it s about the mystery of becoming performing and acting like a haunted skip james record it s got the echoes of ghosts all around rowlands breakdowns which are stupefying and almost operatic surprising coming from cassavetes are accompanied by a jumpy unsettling piano who is this dead girl the metaphysical possibilities are endless and it s amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film just the overt display of intelligence there is also a brief bit of voice over at the beginning but then he always was intelligent he just never flapped it around for easy praise this is not adaptation here the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates there s so much going on the pure joyous love when rowlands greets her doorman the horror when she beats herself up the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone you can see some roots of this in a star is born and almodovar borrowed from it for all about my mother i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening you can shoot me but i think the alcoholism despite its urgency in many of the scenes is a relatively small point about the film it s a living breathing thing and it feels like a process it could go any direction at any time like taste of cherry we are reminded that you must never forget this is only a play yet it is dangerous when rowlands says that line is it great drama how will the audience take it is she being reflexive or does she just not care her character s breakdowns are incorporated into the performances and ultimately the film in such a way that it s like witnessing a female james dean 10 10,1
i usually like these dumb no brain activity movies but this was just too stupid there were way too many clichés and the plot didn t really make much sense there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt we didn t even get too see if the big master plan worked we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther the professor that died because of stupidity see below one scene annoyed me particularly why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen why didn t he bring two or three of them then he would have survived that was bloody stupid the movie is pretty full of such stupid things i can not recommend it at all ,0

this was painful recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper this british belgian co production from 1977 could ve fooled me it looks ten years older than that at least is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half hour mark consider yourself a trouper the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn t really there harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i ve seen with the obligatory trippy moments especially where the animation of the brainiac type subtracto character is involved that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored as for adults stick to jonathan swift s original novel ,0
i bought this rental return for 1 99 at hollywood and overpaid i didn t expect much but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least i quickly noted the very weak storyline the gross overacting by everyone no one talks like that except in cartoons and the seemingly let s make it up as we go along direction i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it and i feel certain that it did not help any careers as for this movie buff of 35 years it has now provided a ready answer for the worst film you ve ever seen question ,0
this is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense the premise of the story the kidnapping of a son by the boy s father is very good but the story just seems to beggar belief whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing ,0
first off i just want to say that this show could ve done well way better than it s doing now what brought it down was certainly the acting miranda cosgrove who acts as the main character carly looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh unfortunately icarly was a big let down not only can miranda not act convincingly enough but she s incredibly stiff when she moves she looks as if she s not sure how the character carly would move or stand in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm doesn t ever leave her side from her elbow up even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze and the singing the theme song was great only because drake had been in it the music was pretty good and miranda s voice sounded fake i have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey that s nick they re practically known for stupid lines and characters but wow is icarly the worst of them all ,0
a shame that even a talented director desplechin could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly talented actress phoenix esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor s plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the redundancy of esther s struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechin s instruction just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over esther s pain we never feel a victory in phoenix s talent ,0
not high art not even exceptionally innovative but a thoroughly enjoyable movie funny fresh intelligent there are still people out there who don t need millions of dollars to hide that they re out of ideas when you compare this to your average hollywood action flick you re comparing a homemade meal with a big mac ,1
this is the second and best in the hunting trilogy what makes it the best is the clever dialogue bugs do you want to shoot me now or wait till you get home it was kind of funny how they kept that going through out the short ,1
oh man i know what your thinking with a title like that i can t go wrong uh yes you can i too loved the title but man i hated the stupid kid that played satan s little helper i hated the mom too and the sister daughter and her boyfriend i hated all those people man it was agony watching this sometimes the only reason this doesn t get 1 10 is becuz condsidering the low budget they did ok but oh man did i hate those actors so stupid i knew it was going to be bad i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too oh the agony do not watch ,0
slash flicks come few and far between now a days so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it those good things i heard were all wrong very wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad it s just plain stupid everything about it especially the killer s origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick just another slasher wannabe with those hip self aware movie savvy characters i m so sick of that crap someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood literally ,0
when i read the synopsis for messiah in the television guide i was not prepared for what was in store the story follows dci metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london he soon realises a pattern there is a serial killer on the loose killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 apostles and their killings are identical to their matching apostle the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat with metcalfe closely pursuing the killer but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill fated victim messiah is sure to cause a great deal of controversy but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time ,1
the sopranos 1999 2007 number 1 television show of all time everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn t go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie falco is superb as the worrying loving upper middle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable i can see so many positives from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters lives which makes the whole thing more interesting credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for envisioning television s most complex and enigmatic character simply exceptional 10 10,1
just to clarify matthew poncelet wasn t a real person but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers i read the user comments and they react as if matthew was real the character is based on a mixture of two killers elmo patrick sonnier and robert lee willie who murdered separate people and the murder itself was based on the one willie committed the conflict of both willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well prejean s approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions she also reaches out to the victims families to help them know that the convict did indeed feel remorse for what they did effectively aiding both parties everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the death sentence it s not my place to say it s right or wrong in theory punishing death with death makes some sort of karmic sense however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days although costly makes more sense to me being stuck in a small room 23 7 with one hour of exercise for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment they are technically alive but denied living say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required like susan smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake i find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that freedom they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned prejean s point comes through the story very well she has my respect she manages to find that balance she isn t supporting a killer she is guiding them to accepting what they did if they didn t feel some kind of remorse they wouldn t be asking for spiritual guidance ona final note when poncelet apologizes to delacroix parent for killing his son the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn t apologize for her death i think the point was that throughout the movie poncelet denies killing both kids there is doubt in prejean s mind he did both killings there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death my thought is that poncelet killed the delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl hence poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did had he been responsible for the girl s death he probably would have apologized for that as well ,1
after having watched darwin s nightmare one must have the impression of tanzania being a living hell with its population being quasi slaves delivering the finest fish to the well fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population in exchange for the fish they get western made weapons which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use because being a soldier is their only source of income so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery not quite fortunately darwin s nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects in fact the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region for the countries around lake victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income the wages in the fishing industry are way above average tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen the adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories exports and profits furthermore tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish which still play an important role feeding the local population by ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the african s situation for further reading i can recommend two articles the german alternative wing newspaper wrote on the subject http www taz de pt 2006 09 02 a0013 1 textdruck http www taz de pt 2005 03 17 a0151 1 text,0
this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever chritopher guest is truly talented he has a gift for humor i almost died laughing actually when i saw this in theaters i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb but it is dumb in a good way it is funny dumb and this is a really good combination you will be laughing from start to end this mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the kennel club dog show the cast includes parker posey fred willard eugene levy catherine o hara john michael higgens michael mckean larry miller bob balaban jennifer coolidge and tons more this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing someone born without a personality would laugh at this film it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity best in show 5 5 ,1
my god buttgereit s masterpiece is one of the best movies i ve ever seen closer to peter greenaway and jean luc godard s movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money see the bridge sketch highly highly recommended ,1
for a while it seemed like this show was on 24 7 then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish haggish airheads perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said i doubt these two ladies have souls and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their lizardly snouts on a television series may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls ,0
keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like don t be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title obviously this film too just anything that has keenans name in the credits it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films 1 10 j d seaton,0
this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died idaho colorado territories and montana it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious bad man good man the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade in real life jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will even to this day ,0
there s no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba i was quite a hand with a slingshot the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face go and sit with the concubines and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan whatever you say he even tries the old my kingdom doesn t understand me routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point so it s probably a tribute to henry king s direction that the film isn t at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide maybe it s the censor baiting nature of the plot a married man kills a femme fatale s husband and gets away with it but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne s script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands and the film doesn t back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives unlike king david which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan s death gregory peck s performance grows in stature as david shrinks susan hayward is pure hollywood pro raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet why be naturalistic when you ve got a voice that makes the very heavens quake and kieron moore s uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can t exactly blame david for putting him in harm s way but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn t allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s 50s biblical epics fox s new dvd is a good transfer including an incredibly hokey candid behind the scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film s sole battle scene ,1
spacecamp is my favorite movie it is a great story and also inspires others the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers invisible going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result so i m much closer to the accident and any movie similarities i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour ,1
i watched deadly voyage because david suchet was in it after enjoying him in the poirot series and joss ackland is always worth watching so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film alas it was not to be i won t bother critiquing the performances the pacing the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film others here have already given their opinions on those elements the only thing i want to address is the film s message since it proclaims in the intro that it s based upon a true story and therein hangs the film s supposed importance deadly voyage primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us because he believes that he can make money there nothing more nothing less his motivation is utterly selfish of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in ghana so he really just created his own problem to that end kingsley decides to stow away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york in the process of doing this he faces harsh conditions racist crew members and other challenges but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley simply because he has a goal goals aren t such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say the goal of the ship s captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child kingsley s goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company if he makes it to the us it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into and if he gets caught the shipping company will be fined 45 000 i doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else they re clearly just out for their own gain he could ve spent the 1 000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film for legal passage to the us and applied for residency and a work permit instead he takes the illegal and dangerous route so since kingsley s voyage is illegal selfish and cannot be ethically justified why should we care about him or his ordeal simply because he faces challenges why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without stowaways because he s black and the shipping company is white the reason seems to be because danny glover the film s executive producer and others involved want us to root for kingsley as if he s a hero on some sort of noble voyage but once you accept that illegal immigration theft and a fool s mission aren t noble at all you can t really care about him before anyone plays the race card i assure you that i would ve felt the same no matter what ethnicity nationality the involved parties were imagine if a british person decided to stow away in a train headed for bhutan sneak across the border and collect unwanted buddhist antiquities to bring back to britain to sell how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate very little i d bet so why should we feel different for kingley because he s black because he s poor by american standards the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means and that a shipping company being fined 45 000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could ve if he had just stayed in his own home country i didn t buy it for a minute ,0
well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo s the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building that s a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if it s a bit slow it s a mix of the omen and rosemary s baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals it s a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the 70 s even if it s nothing greatly original it s wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites 9 10,1
the premise of this film is the only thing worthwhile it is very poorly made but the idea was clever if not entirely original it s a shame the other aspects of the film weren t better the acting is especially bad ,0
good movie great story great characters i enjoyed it immensely enough to buy the dvd when it came out the real life story it purports to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the fictionalizers could ever come up with my friend who is in the media business said they shouldn t show insider dealings like this it gives the business a bad name as if there are a few problems with the dvd though first the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the tv volume to watch it i notice that its also like that when hbo runs it so its in the original production copy second for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side after the five minutes it fills the screen properly left to right sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and i don t know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slide by still even with the technical flaws its an enjoyable story one of hbo s best i think ,1
do not avoid this movie simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film at times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we re pretty sure that it is not characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh histerically then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind don t expect a good movie expect the worst and it will be even worse than that i seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection right next to anchorman ,0
is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant life spanning testimonial of spring summer fall winter and spring the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of 3 iron the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of the coast guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in samaritan girl i just cannot seem to find him in this film oh sure kim s nature motif is still present the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters yes it s kim ki duk all right kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the dvd s special features but i m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation what is beautiful about angry potty mouthed prostitutes lustful violent and potty mouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material it has been favorably compared to audition by japanese director takashi miike much to kim s satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk i find little reason to recommend this film i have not seen audition but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of the isle its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot its point is either non existent or i will admit lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand the only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic kim fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing but as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more ,0
almost a two person play and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important neither are particularly good this might have been stronger in fact if it had first been crafted as a two person play and then worked into a film anyway a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home he wants to have her tell him about the daylight he would have been better off finding someone with a day job or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet but then they might not have a hot bod after he gets her to do whatever he wants and he s not terribly good at it he intends to feed on her at 6 am at which point the sun rises much is made of that deadline despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding it will just make him hungrier additionally he claims he can t let the stripper go since she knows about him but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is there are a lot of inconsistencies why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime i m not sure with all the time in the world you d think he d have done a better job or fixed the place up a bit he s clearly not a wealthy vampire this is supposedly a remake and i m curious to see the original version of this dance of the damned although that was directed by katt shea and the other films she directed for corman stripped to kill stk ii were pretty bad ,0
well now that all of the director productions company s friends and relations have posted their shill reviews after seeing this at various festivals i guess it s time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see it like the director s dear jesse the only other one of his films i have seen loggerheads suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas crammed into an indie budget i swear this guy might have better luck doing miniseries i kept waiting for the various plot threads to come together but they only intercepted at points blatantly forshadowed in a way obvious to all but the most dense viewer it was like watching a season of lifetime made for tv movies crammed into one long did i say looong sketch on the old carol burnett show maybe an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim hey remember all of the chick flicks we went to last year the one about the adoptive mother the one about the gay guy the one about the christian housewife we went to three chick flicks last year so now we have to go see terminator 4 i guess one has to do anything to cast a familiar actor to get funding but what oh what is bonnie hunt doing in this flick she isn t exactly known as a dramatic actress and this attempted performance won t be sending mr oscar to her door i mean speaking of lifetime original movies wasn t valerie bertinelli or farah fawcett available ms hunt has always come off to me as cold maybe she should have played the other mom i wish i would have chosen capote to fill my weekly gay themed indie allowance oh well maybe next week i think there is a good reason why capote is playing at tons of theatres all over the nyc area and this one is playing at only one let the distributors faith in this flick assure to to run in the opposite direction if you don t trust this review ,0
yes i know that this movie is meant as a comedy and the humor is over the top but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched i cannot say that it will happen but if we don t take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility i have noticed that some schools aren t teaching facts anymore like history geography basic stuff the focus is more on learning practical abilities the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with gatorade in stead of water well we can laugh about it but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know to me this is a scary notion so now you understand why this subject isn t funny anymore it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn t improve fast am i taking this movie too seriously yes of course to each his own fun i loved mike judge s work beavis and butthead and office space in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time in idiocracy i missed this most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie ,1
it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you don t have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tv set tip see it with some close friends ,1
this is a generally nice film with good story great actors and great songs the cinematography was unfortunately bad one of the film s weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman why does it hurt to attempt some originality abbas mustan anyone the film is about a newly married couple raj and priya salman rani priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child they pick madhubala a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta the film is not really realistic i mean isn t it easier to adopt and even if they pick a girl does it mean the man has to sleep with her have you heard of insemination anyway i guess if the writers had heard of all this the film wouldn t have been made so the concept is apparently intentional salman acts very well it s nice to see him playing a serious character but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman come on it s cheesy and unrealistic rani is just about ok she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zinta the film belongs to preity who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally she lives the film emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time partly because of her role partly because of her magnetic and positive personality this is one of her career best performances there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries she just should do more such roles the film s ending only highlights what i said above it is tear jerking exciting and very well acted watch it for preity 7 10 for the film 10 10 for preity ,1
i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute a feel good saturday night movie i wasn t expecting anything great figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised the dialogue was pitch perfect most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely ash christian was perfect his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see he could have turned this character into something we ve all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again i didn t know what he would do after tarnation ashley fink is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema my friend described it as a gay angus napoleon dynamite but it s something more than that it s a character study into what it s like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make clearer is magnified i look forward to seeing more of ash christian ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon ,1
the famous french detective henri cassin takes his first vacation in 11 years in st margot where he meets nanette the daughter of the vacation spot proprietors despite nanette being promised to childhood sweetheart leon henri and nanette fall in love and decide to marry despite nanette s father objecting due to henri s age on the day of their wedding leon returns and nanette runs after him nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead and henri swears he won t rest until he can find the killer the only clue henri has to work with is a footprint found by leon but he is also getting written warnings that others will die soon soon nanette s mother is found dead and henri has no idea as to the identity of the killer thinking himself a failure he returns to paris then he realizes and fears that the killer can be only one person even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn t really follow the formula in other of the genre by columbia or other b studios credit to that certainly goes to director lewis who does manage to turn this into a noirish film despite the setting of the film also aided by the use of good camera work and lighting geray turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance rating 8 ,1
this as the first of the ma and pa kettle flicks marjorie main ma steals the show in anything she does funny to see ida moore as emily the daffy old lady on the train god she was always old she was in desk set and alfred hitchcock presents their new house is also a co star here its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that pa doesn t care for love the painting gag keep an eye out for tom he starred in nanny the professor unfortunately he died real young oddly enough his last role was on the series death cruise weird directed by charles lamont who not only directed several of the kettle films he also did a bunch of the abbott and costello flicks so he must have known a thing or two about comedy fun story plain simple humor even the release date was april fool s day 1949 the story starts out by showing us what backward and country folk they are the neighbors are even native americans but as the story progresses we have sympathy and respect for them ,1
don t get me wrong goldeneye was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise but the series had fallen into a fps rut enter everything or nothing which puts bond in third person when i wrote my earlier review for from russia with love i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise eon definitely is superior in terms of in depth controls and gameplay variety missions range from standard running and gunning to driving an suv driving an aston martin driving a limousine that is wired to explode commandeering two different types of tanks a la goldeneye riding a motorcycle flying a helicopter repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires and free falling after a plummeting damsel sure vehicle controls are a little clumsy but the issue here is the variety as movie adaptations goldeneye and frwl were all that i could have hoped for but eon s original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe shannon elizabeth heidi klum and misaki ito judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q respectively and pierce brosnan while no sean connery adds credibility to the game s proceedings all characters resemble the stars with the disappointing exception of heidi klum who s in game model doesn t do the real life model justice mya s theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies willem defoe s character is a former colleague of christopher walken s baddie from a view to a kill richard kiel appears as jaws the hulking henchman from the spy who loved me and moonraker in three fight scenes the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have single player gameplay mainly consists of standard on foot missions as bond like bond you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth with plenty of wall and object cover unfortunately unlike frwl only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging so bond may end up crouching low when he s supposed to be peeking around a corner and vice versa the game also allows players to go into bond reflex mode while you browse your inventory everything around you will go into super slo mo allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with while this takes some getting used to eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular bond moments such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath and greatly add to the bond movie feeling there are 3 available difficulty levels operative agent and double oh on operative you can breeze through in a few hours on agent a few weeks on double oh a few months the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints but when all is said and done no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie multi player unfortunately is not as thrilling goldeneye still has the best multi player mode of any bond game eon s main multi player is a co op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond s a more standard third person death match can be unlocked from this mode but the single player mode is the most complete bond experience to date the ending as with most bond games is anticlimactic while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing also levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error still for any serious bond fan not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films ,1
how could this get a 6 0 rating are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days that when one comes along that has some and i repeat only some redeeming quality s we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high the director has a certain visual flair no doubt about that but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story mood or scares it had a very slow first act lazy killing scene s annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist and what s with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films do they always have to be this stupid irritating and so godd mn superficial i don t remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland all things considered in can t give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating ,0
as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta s shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse this movie is so bad i wouldn t even bother renting it from the weeklies section do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth ,0
it s a short movie for such immense feelings the last 20 or so minutes are among the most intense in the recent years of the industry huston john is dying and only love can make the difference the actor s work in the long evening scene is absolutely marvellous ,1
watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release i am surprised at how well it has held up one of the reasons for its failure was that one generation just thought it was over indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full hippy glory seen now it is clear that antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future the lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film s perceived failure they are ideal and convey perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in lovemaking i blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the start but have to say that from there on in this is one of the directors most beautiful looking pictures and he certainly got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes oh and i haven t even mentioned the highly explosive ending ,1
first of all season 1 is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional they re nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair bound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what s taking place in the show unfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a men s club with guards guards that don t do much near the end of season two an older prisoner s grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but that s okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distraction later shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators let s see what else shillinger s son od s in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he just got them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise you ll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didn t know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr faraj s schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and o reilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a gun i shouldn t go on about stupid ideas in this show but it s like a flood i can t stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who can t speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they re needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robson s gum transplant what s the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesn t belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again it s like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasn t bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mind i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they don t say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you don t think i m gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience won t remember maybe i m spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a low budget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multi season tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i don t understand myself ,0
a cheesy b crime thriller of the early 50 the story is droll the characters wooden allison hayes and abbe lane are the only two sexpots that make it an eye catcher but one short shot only a few frames long shows an el train crossing the river on the state street bridge of the 6000 series pullman built cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme as they were delivered when new in 1950 for traction fans like me that one short take makes the picture worthwhile i think films like this one ulmer s detour d o a with edmund o brien the fugitive with harrison ford and others of the film noir genre big city crime dramas make it interesting if for nothing other than the fact that i know chicago and san francisco intimately and recognize most of the street locations other wise it s a really droll boring film ,0
this is a very beautiful and almost meditative film there is hardly any dialogue in it apart from the narration and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly i didn t at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend who also has red hair it is almost an old fashioned type of children s films saying that children nowadays prefer animations like shrek or toy story etc but i feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages not just children ,1
this is undeniably the scariest game i ve ever played it s not the average shoot everything that moves kind of fps which i usually don t care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game i ve had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere i m a great horror fan escpecially of clive barker s stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 9 10 1 because i m no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short ,1
this show lasted for most of the 1980s and had its moments but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunny terry scott and june whitfield were wasted in this sitcom they both deserved better but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes june whitfield s talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion when she is not being a foil to terry and she really is clever the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class middle aged comedy and many people remember it fondly but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image ,0
the cell is weak on plot filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well but none of this matters for director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer bringing the audience some shocking pleasing breath taking and mind blowing images the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come this movie is a perfect case for the suspension of disbelief theory forget the silly plot just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images and j lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem s work the cinematography is harrowing the music haunting the costumes just stunning the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art its just that the medium is not canvas anymore it is the big screen and celluloid one of the most refreshing movies of this decade the cell is a must watch a bold new step in movie making an enthralling 8 ,1
i m disappointed that reiser who wrote the film felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever maybe that s his idea of adult films plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie falk s acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating this might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles but the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails certainly not worth spending money on though it might be worth a watch for free on television ,1
did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn t pull this one out about two thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i can t believe i signed the contract it s not the worst movie i ever saw but it s on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn t move with vaughn s con man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can t get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into ,0
the british production company amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called the house that dripped blood is doubtlessly the finest amicus production i ve seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that i have yet to see though the house that dripped blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable peter cushing christopher lee cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as denholm elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it no one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast the house that dripped blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening in four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirs the first tale method for murder tells the story of horror novelist charles hyller denholm elliott who moves into the house with his wife after moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation the first segment is a great kickoff to the film the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good in the second story waxworks retired businessman phillip grayson peter cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good the tale is delightfully weird and the second best of the film after the third the third tale sweets to the sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four john reed christopher lee moves in with his little daughter the private teacher and nanny mrs norton whom mr reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employer s strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father s views on upbringing may have this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot christopher lee is as always superb in his role nyree dawn porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then 11 year old chloe franks this ingenious segment alone makes the film a must see for every true horror fan in the fourth segment horror actor paul henderson jon pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistress co star carla ingrid pitt this fourth story is satire more than it is actually horror it is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other horror films at one point henderson indirectly refers to christopher lee who stars in the previous third segment all four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere as stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate an igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must see in short the house that dripped blood is an excellent horror omnibus that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss highly recommended ,1
indeed cynthia watros is in this movie as elizabeth talking to desmond though i m just wondering how she ended up as a rehab patient where hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight as seen from the previous episodes anyway this last episode is really suspended the ending is not so understandable i think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming i just hope the next season will give light to more unclear hanging events that were happened just can t wait further for season 3 ,1
this is a very bad movie however i read that it was made by a high school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it s ambitious yet awful special effects here is the plot a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of milpitas california and embarks on a destructive rampage i m about to spoil the big surprise about what the monster looks like so please read the rest of this at your own risk you have been warned the monster looks sort of like a giant two legged fly wearing a gas mask in some scenes the monster is an actor wearing a costume in other scenes the monster is created by stop motion animation the acting is terrible the dialogue is terrible the special effects are terrible the plot is predictable stay away ,0
it really impresses me that it got made the director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to consider is this while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write the jokes didn t appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you you d have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script form and this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn t it ,0
i will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention zombie 90 is one of the worst films ever made right up there with schnaas other horrible zombie entry zombie doom aka violent sh t 3 these films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot i somehow managed barely to sit through zombie doom but zombie 90 is so horribly inept even when compared to schnaas other horrible film that i had to fast forward through everything after the first 10 minutes zero acting skills inept gore horrible camcorder style camera work ridiculous dubbing it just goes on and on i really can t find a single thing redeeming about this garbage and i can usually find something redeeming in just about any film this truly is one of the worst films ever made you ve been warned 1 10,0
if bob ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlum s work may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was poor mira blair anjelica and colm why did they sign to stoop this low horrible ,0
true the idea for this tv series may have sprung from the immense success which ally mcbeal is enjoying worldwide even here in germany however this said edel starck is very different from ally mcbeal in many ways the two main characters work beautifully together felix edel felix noble played by well known german actor christoph m ohrt and sandra starck sandra strong noble strong get it played by charming rebecca immanuel exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom like criminal cases in berlin and surroundings further they are aided by a magnificent cast of co stars most notably their secretary played by isabel tuengerthal who is a rare gem with great comic potential also the shady wheeler dealer otto and the noble childhood pal of felix frank work very well not to forget sandra s best friend and room mate patricia played by the beautiful barbara demmer all in all a joy to watch on monday nites no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes will felix get sandra i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ,1
this movie is the last straw in a list of films i have seen this week that have pushed me over the edge and forced me to join imdb and spread some warning to the public it was absolutely horrible the film was drawn out and painfully boring the sound effects and even picture quality seemed like they came from willow 1988 or maybe even conan the barbarian 1982 the battle of bannockburn was absolutely absurd this largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the british isles made me snicker there wasn t even a coherent formation at all just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them the scenes of douglas especially in the last battle were simply horrible as was most of the acting in the film ,0
dr chopper starts shortly after teenager nicholas robert adamson mum has died he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at lake tatonka the self proclaimed friendly place for happy people that she didn t tell him about so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica chelsey crisp three friends jimmy butch hansen reese chase hoyt tamara ashley mccarthy head out there for a fun weekend unfortunately things don t go according to plan the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed their neighbours turn out to be dr chopper ed brigadier his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments going straight to video dvd dr chopper was edited directed by lewis schoenburn this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews while i think dr chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless i don t think some of the criticism i ve read is entirely justified the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt whether he likes it or not who has a role in the film as detective crocker according to the imdb cast list although i can t remember any character of that name maybe he was one of the cops at the start anyway the basic story is alright i suppose although it s a tad dull lasts for too long it s typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying american teen cast you know the drill by now besides some brief undeveloped nonsense about dr chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body there s not much story here the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off there s the inevitable sex scenes there s a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless there s even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing oh when i say topless i mean they aren t wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn t any actual full frontal nudity in dr chopper at all so there you have it really it s an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted is populated with poor clichéd dumb character s that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes girls in bras to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe i m just being picky director schoenburn does ok actually this is by no means the worst looking film i ve seen although it still looks cheap there s no style here i didn t think it was scary there s no atmosphere either the gore is restrained restricted to some dead bodies severed limbs there s nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects dr chopper is also one of those films where character decisions motivations are ridiculous technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits the acting is alright it could have better but i ve certainly seen worse dr chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn t enough to satisfy me despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace ,0
one should not be too critical about the director s second feature i really like the camera work of madiba as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things however howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i don t think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 any way if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work ,1
on broadway a chorus line was pure magic from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged captivated by the intensely personal stories some funny some clever some stirring of this chorus line the movie is another matter entirely the focus is now on the director and what an ogre he is every time the film switches to michael douglas there he is with a bitter sour expression barking out questions and orders screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance yikes that changes the dynamics of the story on broadway the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong fragile intriguing hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize and actually in one of the only moments the director appears he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer s heart breaking story he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for cassie but in the movie from the second douglas director starts bitterly barking orders the chorus line members stories become secondary it s like they are in a lousy profession where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show is jaded exhausted furious at having to audition these chorus members on stage there was always the excitement of the show here in the movie practically from the word go you feel sorry for everyone involved during the course of the musical we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job but of course that couldn t happen but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage sometimes reflecting us in the audience in our hearts and we know also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much bringing magic to the theatre in the movie after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis that magic becomes totally diluted all we feel even with the exact same curtain call is that some of the members got a job with a mean spirited director so they all come on the screen and are dancing again big deal ,0
the green butchers anders thomas jensen denmark 2003 how do the danes keep coming up with these films that are consistently funny sharply written exquisitely filmed and filled with great performances the green butchers is a dark and wickedly funny comedy in many ways the danish counterpart of eating raoul and delicatessen but it has more on offer than just laughs or parody the film brings us the duo of chronic pothead bjarne nikolaj lie kaas and chronic perspirer svend mads mikkelsen sick of their evil boss the two pals decide to open their own butcher shop in a small danish town but initially business is slow and customers stay away when an electrician is accidentally locked up and freezes in their meat locker svend decides to turn the man s thigh into fillets he promptly nicknames chickie wickies this special dish suddenly has everyone in town flocking to their counter and svend unable to resist this sudden leap into popularity turns into a serial killer with bjarne acting as his reluctant accomplice but soon led by their ex boss many people in town are starting to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using without the extraordinary performances by kaas and mikkelsen the film might not have risen above the level of the average black comedy on paper the character of svend might border on caricature but mads mikkelsen portrait is that of an earnest insecure and deeply twisted man but mikkelsen manages to make him frightening funny and moving at the same time kaas actually plays a double role also playing his comatose twin brother eigil when watching the film i never even realized it was the same actor the other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town refreshingly off the hook with some truly wonderful vignettes the subject material is naturally a bit morbid and the material might not be completely fresh considering quite a few predecessors that handled the same kind of material but director jensen gives it a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo of svend and bjarne with this wonderfully bizarre tale of two social misfits camera obscura 9 10,1

that s how i was when i walked staggered out of this film i couldn t leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people i was stuck in the middle trapped the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen the daughter was a stand out performance stand out in the bad sense thge cinematography was hideous consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i ve witnessed as for the stock footage well at first one wait why am i reviewing this film why do i acknowledge its existence please don t watch it do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry ,0
this is my favorite renoir from the fifties it s the story of how henri danglard built and launched the moulin rouge nightclub we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described gabin is in great form as the easy going danglard see him deal humorously with nini s violent boyfriend gianni esposito is moving as the wistful prince who is courting nini maria felix with that amazon s body is imposing as the egotistical lola danglard s first lover finally françoise arnoul as nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for danglard and becoming his girl is just stunning her loveliness and pert charm will win you over a bonus we get edith piaf patachou andré claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the moulin rouge ,1

this isn t a very good movie but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed lloyd kaufman the brains behind troma isn t concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film his chief concern is making something bizarre and his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinema in this film we have the titled character luther whose favorite pastime isn t baseball but biting the heads off of chickens receiving his release from lockup the board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesn t speak he merely clucks like a chicken and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal of course once luther is set free he goes about causing mayhem first at a grocery store and later at a farm house violence lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse nudity stacy haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture as the former lois lane i can t recall which superman edition she was from gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend a guy who just doesn t have any chemistry with ms haiduk the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of stacy she is quite something story forgettaboutit whitey styles screenplay may just be the worst ever written the way in which luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window his dialogue is something that a pre schooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd it s as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations acting the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek he is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but haiduk and her boyfriend s lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best ,0
this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat down from what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the case the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate pain sounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one ,1
i made it about 8 minutes into steel frontier before i turned it off then glutton for punishment that i am i watched some more the next day today i had to iron a pile of clothes so i decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment here s what i don t understand robert rodriguez and shane carruth each spent 7 000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they churn out a huge steaming pile of crap let me see if i can figure out the logic it s road warrior but it s like a future western we ll get the cheapest actors we can find we ll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and we ll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions we can t lose seriously i don t think even the mst3k guys could improve this but if you insist on watching it i recommend getting very drunk first ,0
this film was a yawn from titles to credits it s boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted admittedly this was director richard jobson directing debut but who on earth green lit a script as poorly developed as this one looks like another money down the drain government project scottish screen are credited surprise surprise i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one please please mister jobson what ever you ve been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film go back to it ,0
the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a motivational speaker that part was just stupid i mean why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker is alexander stone really that disorganized first he can t decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no reliability for example the part of the the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something and gillen lane s family they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water i might add that since casper van dien gillen lane is only in his twenties or that s the impression that i had and has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes tbn s family values also why did this film have to be so damn propaganda like i ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated this film doesn t do that the beginnig starts off well with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy s omega code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two prophets tell him tell your master that we are here dominic ironsides replies he already knows and points to a small surveillance camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film i ll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael ironsides but the good guys are horrible i ve already went on about lane s family now that i m over the acting i ll get on to plot this is obviously a baptist film since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well done also another diatribe against the vatican their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded since gillen explains to the pope that it s not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the vatican or israelis says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world whoever it was they wouldn t just secede they d send over commandoes and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying we re not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor mediocre in short ,0
saxophonist ronnie bowers dick powell wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood he stays at hollywwod hotel of course at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall lola lane has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia rosemary lane to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it s not marshall naturally they fall in love you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself the plot is old to put it nicely but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices the score is good highlighted by hooray for hollywood and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive in musical sequence with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie still the movie isn t that good the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy also there is racism a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there s some truly appalling racist humor at one point that s probably what keeps this off tv most of the time i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today all in all a so so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs i give it a 7 ,1
the plot in petites coupures certainly left this viewer dumbfounded spoiler in the space of 48hrs or so auteuil s character has an affair with a teenager loses his wife s affections attempts to seduce scott thomas is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble end of spoiler wha the only saving grace in this flick is kristin scott thomas similar to charlotte rampling she seems a natural to star in french cinema my hope is that one day françois ozon may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent there are some fine french films such as the remarkable le colonel chabert begging for a dvd release yet this is the tripe that gets chosen avoid this one zzzz ,0
it s possible that a man called sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor maybe someone will demand a director s cut one day but i seriously doubt it james garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of americans over to fill the cast out folks like dennis weaver claude akins john marley and of course we have vic morrow who both wrote and directed this film garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he s so darn good at playing them but he has played serious and done it well in films like the children s hour and hour of the gun he can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully but a man called sledge can t be counted as one of his successes he s got the title role as luther sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head after partner tony young gets killed in a saloon and garner takes appropriate eastwood style measures he s followed from the saloon by john marley marley s spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run garner gets his gang together for a heist here s where the movie goes totally off the wall usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning certainly that was the case in the war wagon which some other reviewer cited but in this one garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake us marshal dennis weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed that was just too much to swallow if taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before but i will say for those who like the blood and guts of italian westerns during that prison break there s enough there for three movies that s not the whole thing of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends but by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency the great movie singer of the thirties allan jones is listed in the credits but for the life of me i can t find him in the film maybe a chorus of the donkey serenade might have made this better couldn t have hurt any ,0
this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a jacobi on board must have excited the money men all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week jacobi camps it up in the way that only jacobi can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in frasier a few years back vinnie jones is not exactly bad he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man he is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series it may have just got picked up however the scipt and the camera work were appalling quite why this jounalist and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained it certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there is none there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all it was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours you life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish,0
child sexploitation is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and i feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience after having seen both trade and holly one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws the other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide i do not believe that turning this issue into a hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and i must commend the makes of holly for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure trade wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts i found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause if i had wanted a cheap laugh i would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking for anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something i would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of holly ,1
unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney pollack soapy plot revolves around adulterous couple perishing in a plane wreck leaving their spouses to find eachother and connect on their own intimate level romance novel writing gets sluggish treatment although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and kristen scott thomas were fine slick production holds interest even though the plot keeps covering the same ground and never builds any emotional momentum as a result the climax in the airport is a big so what ,0
mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in china in 1948 wei wei s stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it,1
i enjoyed this film it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter o donnell a number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became before the network before willie garvin the pace is a trifle slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version if you like modesty blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly ,1
the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists and rightly so this deserves a lot better treatment the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case the old man bianlian wang xu zhu is kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin the little girl doggie zhou renying is a cutie the rest of the story is how the two manage after that i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes overall it s involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness just don t expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd until it comes out on widescreen rent it ,1
with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie well it is a stupid movie with a horrid script but the f x namely the eight legged freaks makes this flick a hoot to watch a tribute albeit on the silly side to those great mutant creature features of the 50s arquette and sheriff sam kari wuhrer summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in arizona also in the cast are doug e doug rick overton leon rippy and the charming scarlett johansson ,0

 but i regret having seen it since the ratings on imdb are relatively high and they must also have been relatively high on netflix i guess i put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the uk a category that has produced many films i liked immensely saving grace on the other hand falls into the category of laugh less comedies usually populated by hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless brenda blethyn is a capable actress and i have liked her in other movies the concept a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband s death does not offend me notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor the film falls flat on its face falling flat on its arse might have been funnier as far as i and my wife were concerned be forewarned oh gentle reader not all offbeat british comedies succeed this one is a dud ,0

i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess the range of different types of people is great it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough my favorite character must be mr aoki he is so quirky but so full of emotions it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool would make for the perfect sequel if they had but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened a very simple and innocent story he stays loyal to his wife and daughter i haven t seen the hollywood remake not sure if i want to i don t really enjoy jennifer lopez i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent ,1
 welcome to collinwood is kind of a disaster considering the people involved it should ve been multiple times better watching it if you re at least somewhat attached to the faith that it ll get better will probably make you cry it s one of those movies that had potential but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary george clooney character and the guy who reminds me of richard dreyfuss but about whom i care so little that i don t even want to know his name the film s only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces i found myself thinking of it time and time again as i watched more crime capers this is the only reason i gave the film a 3 the plot is boring the characters are neurotic needlessly offensive and highly unlikable they are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they re all so irritating that i celebrated their obstacles they yell at each other and swear crassly the dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points i find that steven traffic soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and george clooney are to blame for this they should be tried for war crimes if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care ,0
this film was both entertaining and thought provoking i d recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged great acting directing and it is canadian to boot it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle be it financial or illness this film strikes a resounding chord it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way without cheaply capitalizing on all the gohst and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks ,1
pure schlock from beginning to end the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination otherwise it s a pure camp fest endurance test like one of those so so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say you ll see every plot twist a mile off in this by the numbers romp however it s worth seeing for its portrayal of drag king prostitutes a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them how s that for role reversal and lesbian soap operas the ghost of valerie solanis lives ,0
it s a cooking competition show americanized it s not going to be the japanese version the show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman truly a good way to spend some time watching tv you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge but meh it s entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize oh yeah and i m bitter john besh isn t the new iron chef ala cuisine ,1
what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70 s 80 s but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop ,0
this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet frankentstein it was a somewhat desparate yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man frankenstein s monster and dracula one last time i say desparate because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn t be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn t get cured then there d be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that s fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get cured i know i just said that this shouldn t have been included but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time and the scene with the lady playing moonlight senada on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula s spell was very eerie dr edleman s transformation into the dr jekyl mr hyde type character was also done very well and it s great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time out of ,1
yes be my love was mario lanza s skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema asthma ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful ,1
mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke you have no idea what s happening on the screen with the irritating theme song suzanne being played over and over throughout the movie until when the second coming of suzanne is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing this off the wall armature movie maker logan jared martin is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne sandra locke who reminds him of someone he knew in another life jesus christ with logan s assistant and all around gofer clavius richard dreyfuss somehow getting a 740 000 00 loan from the bank to finance logan s masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon paul sand but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy kari avalos who s cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to failed it s not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there was this supposed to show us in the audience that she like jesus could miraculously heal the sick there s also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair gene barry who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid life crisis or has seen a biblical like vision that changed his life forever sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it s all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there s all this suffering in the world like this movie that he s in and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur david mark rasmusser who s gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coast the movie the second coming of suzanne goes on with a number of unrelated sequences probably to fill or pad in some time by it s director and film editor and then goes to it s final scene in a christ like crucification on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate on the helpless and tied up suzanne the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2 000 years ago hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow the second coming of suzanne puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film the movie tries to be arty but that s just an excuse to cover up it s brainless and non existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it ,0
major spoilers this is for people who have seen the movie commenters have touched on the major theme of honor in the film and too many comparisons to braveheart i ll point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch on this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion the first character to get pregnant is the villain s roth girlfriend and when he coldly suggests an abortion she states it is too late for that the shame of her situation i m to have a bastard s bastard leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene the second character to find herself pregnant is mary rob s wife after a rape by roth s character and at least one sex scene with her husband rob late in the movie as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins with a tone hinting of abortion rob replies in a noble tone it s not the fault of the child and then states what he thinks the name should be girl or boy i find this pro life stance on the part of the hero to be very un hollywood rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment not coincidental symbolism another related theme is roth s character is a bastard someone who evidently does not know who his father was and has few kind words for his mother though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck is it coincidence that roth devoid of family stability is the walking definition of psychopath while rob is the strong husband father figure and of course the hero in the final sword fight between rob and the villain roth the former slices the latter deeply across the chest the left side of the chest over the heart his employer and pseudo father figure john hurt character holds the mother s picture in his hand and gazes at it before snatching it from the neck of the dead roth also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene which was not quite graphic but neither was it off camera and implied i found it surprising in it s somewhat matter of fact depiction with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and subsequent post traumatic stress as we call it now my point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to take in the final fight scene i have to correct an earlier commenter the weapon roth chose was a rapier or perhaps a short sword the weapon rob chose was a claymore someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene roth would have the upper hand in such a situation but of course the claymore is a distinctly scottish weapon what is even more striking to me as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made the actors seem actually trying to kill each other not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights including the movies opening fight even more true to history roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon which is it s purpose by design rapiers were edged but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust rob uses the claymore in broad slashes as it s design intent the fight goes down as i would expect it to roth effectively wins though rob wins the day by grabbing roth s weapon more symbolism and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut folks it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight i ll also note that for whatever reason i remember 1995 the year of release distinctly as a time of distrust of the u s government hollywood was obviously tuned into that with the release of both rob roy and braveheart and i think the anti government leanings are why both films get so much comparison i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans tired of the same old not so hidden messages from hollywood ,1
this is really a great unknown movie perfect dialogue without the typical clichés this movie relied on the actor s talent and it was pulled off it even had a little bit a comedy in it but it wasn t overdone once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all now onto the actors themselves laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal it s a shame that he s only allowed to show his talent in his own movie titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne s junky half brother eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey drug lord i loved his acting since king of new york but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan who were paired perfectly as two of calderon s henchmen once in the life is for sure a keeper 1 2 out of ,1
i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews what a disappointment there are so many ways that this movie is bad the computer graphics were lacking to say the least i found the acting stiff and unbelievable watch the sand as the lost e pods what an original name are found where did all the tracks come from i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies ie alien pitch black come on one huge ship to transport one prisoner and what is with the prisoner does he speak can he speak i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together but it never came if this movie was made on a low budget it shows the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended i don t mean that i liked the ending i didn t i just liked the fact that it was over a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable in my opinion don t waste your time on this one ,0
1st watched 4 29 2007 4 out of 10 dir mick garris campy vampire like stephen king movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3 4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for king fans it s the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers a shape shifting feline like flesh eating life needing near extinct breed of humanoid who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive they come across as pretty normal upper class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home day and night cats are deadly to them so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down we get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack which is also a first in my movie going experience hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film the boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a sleepwalker and then he just wants her body there is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all out satirical comedy on suburban life but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he d just get over it and bring out the gore eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it s typical stephen king downbeat ending the movie is interesting because king s humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn t cut it ,0
this is how i interpreted the movie first things first there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy taylor torturing or nailing ben s hands to the wall however the same cannot be told of the gals in the end too u see taylor disappear as he walks looks like the message there was there was no taylor and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben also there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben it was taylor all the time but in real taylor was ben if they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times but of course before that u do see both of them together and that cud just be ben s imagination at work also when ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that ben s story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained read mine cars etc even after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben she doesn t find him why because ben taylor was out looking for the gals instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylor s ben web cam photos etc somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz both of them knew that taylor was ben so my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination otherwise if there really was a taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben ,1
trying to conceive of something as insipid as the sentinel would be pretty difficult the problems are many the result is terrible and loaded with plot holes michael douglas stars as pete garrison a secret service agent who took one for reagan during the attempt on his life years later we find pete assigned to the whitehouse family mainly as a guard for the first lady kim basinger l a confidential troubles arise as we see pete s close involvement with the first lady and a sudden threat against the president himself david rasche united 93 when pete fails a polygraph test he s singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator david breckinridge kiefer sutherland 24 tv series as the presidential assassination plot unfolds pete finds himself on the run from his own people his only confidant is the first lady and she s reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another which is why pete failed the polygraph in the first place but is pete really innocent or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president if he is innocent how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the secret service the one big overwhelming problem with this film is that there s no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat isn t that what the movie s supposed to be about one would think so but the audience is never let in on why the assassin s want to kill the prez hmm someone forget to put that in the script somewhere and what s with david breckinridge s kiefer s new partner jill marin eva longoria carlita s way seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a candy what was her purpose again did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low cut blouse there are so many problems with the basic premise of the sentinel as to be laughable the action is too easily stymied by the what the responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie ,0
i went to see this film over matchstick men in fact buying the tickets to matchstick men and going to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action romance thrills jungles and exotic locations they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of story all i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight narrative instead of some sappy flashback story here is all the movies from what i ve seen the film was derived from of course indiana jones and romancing the stone but also true lies proof of life that old 80s tom selleck movie bananas woody allen and hero from the use of digital extras ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up ,0
i saw this film at the boston internation festival of women s cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms troche tell us in her q a after the screening that she doesn t expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the so called gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so it s really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose troche s direction make this one of the funniest films i ve seen ,1
just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say yes the acting is cheesy some of the effects are laughable but you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005 and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last week i have read the book so many times and found myself going ahh yes that s in the book almost all the time with the other version hardly anything of the book existed so well done for at least trying to make a true version ,1
frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns he was a great actor from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that but he did not have the physique of a western hero you identified him as an urban guy but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault i blame it on two factors a the story was too unusual specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern to break away from it the film has to be very good b the story is not convincing it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible why all the gunfighters have not adopted it i think that this film should not have been withdrawn because any film with sinatra is worth seeing and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable,0
trite clichéd dialog and plotting the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies hokey music and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans what saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshi s work the rotoscoping and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him this is frazetta in motion the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword sorcery movie of the period i like to watch this with the sound off playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead ,0
i saw this at the screening at gencon in indy i had some time to kill and decided to check it out it played to about 1000 people in a packed standing room only ballroom wow what a ride the script was tight the action tense the pacing perfect the character exposition excellent one thing i really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn t a big budget film yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations and it was more than enough it s true that this film was targeted at a certain audience gamers tabletop players the creators make no effort to hide that but other filmmakers could learn a lot from them for in going for the jugular in scene after scene and not worrying about if mom who happens to be watching will get it they got the biggest laughs time and time again but there s enough universality there that mom will be laughing too even if she s not in on every joke i think too many times i see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they will appeal to the most people but the movie just ends up suffering for it but not this flick indeed this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it s finger from the opening credits and while the viewers around me really wanted to like the film they weren t pushovers gamers can be among the most critical niche out there i m so glad i got to see this in a big crowd at least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they erupted into applause at a joke or scene during the film how often does that happen at screenings it should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled for my own part i can t wait for this to be released after it ended one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous tv dvd release that date cannot come soon enough ,1
i try to be diverse in my movie watching i can get into pride and prejudice as easily as i get into disappearing acts love jones is my all time favorite it is the standard by which i judge any modern urban romantic comedy shot very well the shot of nia and darius riding up lakeshore drive on the motorcycle is one of classic 3 second movie shots of all time of course no one will ever remember it when it came out i though it would be a new paradigm for modern urban film making good actors no guns and so forth the movie industry has disappointed me to a certain degree you will have your occasional drumline or roll bounce or tyler perry s why did i get married so whenever i need to see my people presented on screen in a very professional and stylish way i pop in love jones there is no best movie ever made to many people and opinions for that but it is my personal best my favorite line from love jones baby i just wanna come up and talk ,1
there is only one racist joke in this daffy duck short which is basically when daffy rides black beauty it is a black woman i can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn t even illegal to discriminate black people yet aside from this point a coy decoy is basically a fun interesting short where daffy meets characters in books and does things in books i liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here the way daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time porky is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well blood thirsty terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry i also liked the style of animation used and the theme of the episode for people who are totally into daffy duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons enjoy a coy decoy available on youtube ,1
where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is let s start with the campy hick humor it isn t very funny add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art carney who should have known better than to do this movie and then there is the plot a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper at least they get what they want and then just when the movie should end they can t come up with a more plausible last scene than a well i won t ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse gailard sartain is one of them for me and he has a more prominent role that s a sure sign that the movie probably won t be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations even exceeds them by being worse than poor let s just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than roadie ,0
i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating this was a big disappointment this doesn t hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the dead day of the dead land of the dead etc horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going you have to build up the characters so when they snuff it you feel some empathy etc but even so there s a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you sniff a corpse up to that point its like watching a bad soap opera nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first time you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes you won t miss anything plot wise when things do get going its all very sub par stuff some of the kills and make up are done well others are done very poorly consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting i ve ever seen this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired firebombs being let off no pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air c mon we re not all simpletons oh and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter jet s missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred yards away i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main defects listed above had zero credibility one to miss ,0
i don t understand the exaggerated good critics about this film except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region the movie first of all is too repetitive a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles so you get the impression that it s a time filler a time filler is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock all actors are quite bad by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit pedro by the way this is not a representative movie about the people of the region caribean zone it tends to ridicules them ,0
what is this a low budget sex comedy anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain they could come up with a better idea i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s and people like them this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one you can t let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing he ll never want to go to spain this should be rated r because only people 35 seem to laugh watching s i m truly disappointed maybe i don t like gays which is quite an important part of the movie foreign humor is awful in films except kusturica stick with doing dramas if you want a new comedy try talladega nights,0
this movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies i have seen the acting was utterly superb and when i wasn t drying my tears i enjoyed meryl streep who s performance was extraordinary the movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer the movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking the soundtrack fits this movie to a tee brava bette midler out of 5 stars i give this one 4 1 2 ,1
as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young 20 year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60 s and early 70 s despite what hollywood may think trombone player from oregon,0
 warning minor spoilers i ran into this one partway through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didn t know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can t be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don t want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a sting operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn t show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn t have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in it otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it 7 10 it made me think now i m interested to find out the facts of the real case one more thing the movie was done in 1996 some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie p s meadow sisto is lovely i hadn t seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol ,1
i have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take because of its length and story i liked it very much i was impressed first by the script and then by the realization of this script the film takes you on a ride but that is not an easy joyful ride it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people s lives what i loved was the inner logic the film followed logic which just like logic in life was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end when i thought about it all the events and twists made sense it makes no sense though to try to re tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time i also liked very much nikita mikhalkov s character aleksei and the way he played it as some critics would saw with restless abandon what i didn t like about it was that i think he later played characters that remind me of aleksei in films like cruel romance zhestokij romans which i actually love and to some extent in the insulted and the injured unizhennye i oskorblyonnye sibiriada shows i think what a great film maker andrei konchalovski was before he went to hollywood and made forgettable films like tango and cash and less forgettable like runaway train i would prefer kurochka ryaba to them ,1
john cassavette s decided as his first film obviously as one shot on a shoestring in new york to not even have a script with dialog and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of larry david s curb your enthusiasm all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk in other words it s one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation jazzed sweetly in it s score and telling a tale of racial tensions a group of black siblings are the center point with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip club and has a sister much more light skinned than him who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship which shatters both sides the film however isn t exclusively about that cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around new york city which not many films did in 1959 1960 and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day dated to be sure but worth a glance for film buffs martin scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences ,1
i wanted to like this one the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting but the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow the director is unfairly prejudiced against the goy characters content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine the potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine and start dealing honestly with issues this movie more closely resembles the 7 pieces of gold another earnest failure more than the piano a real tale of passion ,0
i was expecting a lot better from the battlestar galactica franchise very boring prequel to the main series after the first 30 minutes i was waiting for it to end the characters do a lot of talking about religion computers programming retribution etc there are gangsters mafia types who carry out hits however caprica doesn t have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies as a general rule if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation then you know the movie will be a dud caprica has lots of this the director writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies it never works and all it does is demean the very young actresses involved and i feel sorry for them directors writers who do this should be banned from the business if you want to be bored for an hour and a half by all means rent caprica there s free porn on the net if you really want to see naked bodies otherwise move along nothing to see here ,0
i ve seen this movie a few times and with each viewing i still feel the excitement of embarking on a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that impede the path it s more than a mere desire of finding home it s about the very basic human spirit of finding one s way in the world of overcoming despair of facing the character foibles that deter our goals underlying these human endeavors is the challenge to reconsider the origin of life while this film is imbued with serious ideas it has just enough comedic lines to leave the viewers hopeful it is surprisingly funny the execution of the story line is excellent this is all packaged with visually engaging animation a must see ,1
what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it i bought it because god help me i m a sucker for old b cinema even as worthless as this nonetheless something about this movie irritates me it s probably janet janet comes off cold snooty seemingly with the intention of coming off as deep and noble with a look on her face that screams constipation she can t seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants i m glad that this is her only role what really irritates me is that this is a 1960 s gore film gone terribly awry and as we all know awry is floridian for zero gore it s like the director started with a herschell lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other and basically a whole lot of irritating nothing in other words we end up with florida bore joseph adler should be embarrassed janets boyfriend jason is almost as ridiculous as she is this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything come to think of it he s probably the least likable good guy in horror history the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60 s early 70 s b gore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker his pals blood freak or most anything from herschell lewis even rodney from the gruesome twosome is in this i ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating most everything from reel to reel is stupid even the trip scene was stupid the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect in the only real ironic twist scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started around the 45 minute mark if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable but are offended by the color red you might not hate this why does troma distribute this wouldn t this be something weird video s area scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horror gore of its era but i suppose underneath the unlikeable characters and the incoherent plot lies potential scream baby scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern so to steal a quote from janet if it doesn t fit i throw it out 2 10,0
ok this movie was the worst display i have seen in years the actors weren t to bad i figured it was a b movie so they were doing b movie acting anyways i watched this movie thinking oh cool a ufo sci fi movie wrong it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people the last scene was extremely messed up that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something what someone believe in is a matter of opinion this movie just shows how corrupted religion is especially christianity if you want to watch a b movie this ain t if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses well this is the pick of the litter go right for it if you are going to convey a message do it don t force it ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such a degree especially christians ,0
the railway children at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long time british character actor lionel jeffries is an unmitigated classic it tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm the sentimentality is muted the evocation of childhood adventures is involving and jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production the waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in edwardian london the father is prosperous the mother is beautiful and loving the children are well mannered and affectionate their home is warm and cozy then one night during the christmas holidays two men appear at the doorstep talk quietly to the father and then take him away in a moment the lives of mrs waterbury dinah sheridan and bobbie 14 jenny agutter phyllis 12 sally thomsett and young peter gary warren have been changed only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through now teetering into poverty mrs waterbury takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near a rail line not too far from a small village with a train station the children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train chugs by one day an old gentleman going to his business in the city looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back it s not long before he will play an important part in the story as time passes mrs waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children she begins to write stories to earn money she teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them the story however is about these three children especially bobbie at 14 she is old enough to want to share her mother s worries yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother they find a poor man at the station who cannot speak english they discover he is a russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are they insist he must come home with them and their mother takes him in before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help they help a young man taking part in a steeplechase who breaks his leg in a train tunnel soon he is at their home recuperating they decide to have a birthday party for the station master a man with few friends and several children who is a stickler for his dignity it s not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity in other words the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy endings but what of their own problems bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of treason of giving state secrets to the russians will bobbie be able to find a way to help will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train will their father s case be reopened will there be a happy ending jenny agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part she plays the 14 year old bobbie with great naturalness and charm as important as the other players are especially dinah sheridan as the mother agutter is the heart of the story for me it is jenny agutter s talent and lionel jeffries style and restraint that make this movie so memorable the story s problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved and jeffries does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us this might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk or a slow close up of a small yellow wildflower in the grass outside bobbie s home then a slow pull back from a yellow oil lamp being turned up inside or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill all suddenly recall those charming edwardian hand tinted drawings of a perfect by gone time perhaps this gentle story can t compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their nintendo monster splatting skills i m almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents especially those weaned on batman and leone still it s a perfectly put together movie and shouldn t be forgotten as an aside 19 years later the story was retold as a television program this time jenny agutter played the mother ,1
if you like sci fi monsters and ancient legends then you will love this movie the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little less than desirable the story line and effects adequately compensated for it i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv if you like non stop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and lore you have to see this movie ,1
as an adventure mini series this is about as good as it gets i viewed it when it was originally shown on hbo sigrid is totally believable in her role as philadelphia and the whole production was first rate see all 400 minutes of it if you can i highly recommend this mini series amazing that i can t rate it officially but for you readers users i will let you know it s a solid 10 ,1
if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot or corny acting then backdraft is definitely the one however if like me you like watching films that you can believe then backdraft has some serious flaws it doesn t offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90 s action films that follow identical formulas whilst not being quite as clunky after two firefights i m thinking this has got to go somewhere else i mean how many big fires are there in one city surely firemen do other things such as getting cats out of trees well i was wrong and the repetition continues again and again up until the end a good aspect of the film is the fire itself well filmed and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste ,0
this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and b lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today ,1
this movie just seemed to lack direction the plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering the exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character s back stories which were a little weak to begin with all in all i would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven t seen before you re much better off just watching the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose ,0
it s this sort of movie that you try and imitate by attempting to realise something then flying through the air almost immediately i d like to do that and i know you would too great stuff ,1
the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason he says for it s written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood and i saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication s and upon her forehead was written behold i am the great mother of an inaudible word i couldn t make out no matter how many times i rewound the tape and tried to sorry and all abominations of the earth this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre after the opening credits which are set over shots of transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we re in los angeles california u s a city of the angels i knew i was in for a long 86 minutes it s probably not too long after the events of the original howling 1981 and it s karen white s funeral after the ceremony karen s brother ben reb brown is spoken to by an occult investigator called stefan crosscoe christopher lee who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life ben dismisses such nonsense but together with one of karen s friends and colleagues jenny annie mcenroe he visits stefan at his home there stefan tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed he mentions stirba sybil danning who is the queen of werewolves stefan also shows them a photograph taken at karen s funeral of a woman named mariana marsha a hunt and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen stefan says he will stake any werewoves through the heart with titanium ben figures out that stefan means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister s crypt is to stop stefan however lots of werewolves turn up and attack stefan ben and jenny they survive the attack and manage to find out that stirba is to be found in transylvania they all decide to travel to transylvania and stop stirba and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse once there they travel to a small town called vlkava which means where wolves live and meet up with the local priest father florin ladislav krecmer and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters hey what else can i call them oh and a dwarf named florica ludmila safarova helps too they follow mariana who they hope will lead them to stirba but stirba knows of stefan s arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny will stefan be able to put an end to stirba s plans for world domination will this film get any more bizarre or surreal watch it and find out directed by philippe mora this is one strange mess of a film it s poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently the single biggest problem is the script by robert sano and gary brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn t make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring unlike the original something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained most people will probably hate it but for those of us who enjoy bad films this is right up there with the best of them there are werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch we get some cool werewolf killing weaponry the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i don t know if this was actually shot in transylvania but it doesn t look like what i thought mid 80 s transylvania would stirba s castle is part dungeon part gothic castle and part modern luxury house stirba and her servant s costumes are very over the top stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too the special make up effects range from good to poor a dwarf s eyes explode someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn t a film loaded with gore although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf transformations and attacks there is plenty of nudity as well as stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of werewolves i should also mention the music the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film i wonder what he thinks of it basically the whole thing is a real mess but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage it also features the same shot of sybil danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times if that s your thing ,0
i loved this movie when i was a kid i saw it theatrically randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack david seville is the chipmunks father and recording manager the chipmunks consist of alvin who is best known for playing the harmonica simon who is a bright and studious chipmunk theodore who is the youngest and is always hungry there is a lady known as miss miller who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany jeanette eleanor who all have the same character as the chipmunks my favourite songs from this soundtrack include diamond dolls the girls of rock roll the touching my mother alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business the chipmunks meet the chipettes playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing ,1
i myself feel this film is a rare treasure not only is it the beginning of shirley temple s career but a rare look on how our society has changed you have to understand certain things we today would view as sexual back then would be considered innocent for example the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie saw this as just children mimicking adults most people didn t think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls to them it wasn t sexual mind you this was before we had internet tv etc most sex crimes weren t openly brought up occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the funny uncle but that was often all that came of it yes very sad but it is kinda sad today for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended innocent and funny when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her yes i felt disturbed i have to remind myself the time this took place those children didn t know what sex was the parents knew that both those of the children in the movie and those watching it the thought may not have even entered their minds in the eyes of the average adult back then this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house even today kids will enter beauty contest many dressed up extremely maturely for a three yr old however the child is merely pretending i don t blame the child for wanting to act like an adult or the old movies that display this in all honesty our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong this sometimes can be for the best but i truly believe this movie isn t one of them it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality that we have long lost ,1
look if i were interested in a nancy drew book what i would do is pick up a book and read it i m not ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it wasn t like the book i m sorry in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however i m sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form when lord of the rings came out people complained when the third one won an oscar the book was better when i watched to kill a mockingbird the book was better now a bunch of people are upset yet again because nancy drew wasn t like the book i m not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars if anything it ll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards i m saying give film a break it s film not paper as a movie i found nancy drew quite enjoyable featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg the hebrew hammer and supporting roles featuring tate donovan jimmy cooper on the o c and rachel leigh cook she s all that this is the first time i ve seen emma roberts in a movie and frankly i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of eric s her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon dvd release ,1
i couldn t even sit through the whole thing this movie was a piece of crap i had more fun watching dont tell mom the babysitter s dead it was just too painful to watch say besides austin powers has tom arnold ever been in a hit movie ,0
in the process of boring you with the wordy rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development it manages to enforce a few negative black stereotypes out there at one point i was wondering if jesse helms co wrote the screenplay ,0
in the lost son a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring this film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst case scenario that exists only in the minds of hollywood the press and ag john asscrap if you get a chance to see this you d be better off getting lost yourself ,0
the big bad swim has a low budget indie feel about it so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious crud voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremost i do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor if it does then i missed it from the get go bbs felt right it was easy and warm and human there were no major dramas or meaningful insights i just connected with the characters straight off and when as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connection if you are looking for something big or fast or insightful look elsewhere look for a film trying to deliver more than it can bbs delivers a solid enjoyable real experience and i felt rewarded and satiated having watched it ,1
i did something a little daring tonight when i watched this movie i attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores sure when this film originally was distributed a piano score was probably played with it oftentimes the director would choose the score himself charlie chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films but most of the music you hear on vhs tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released and then again there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score i do not know the history of potemkin s score so i decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within film soon after i turned the music off unaided or should i say unimpeded by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen i became utterly attached to the film visually it is easily one of the most stunning of all films eisenstein was a master of composition the editing possibly the cinematic technique eisenstein is most famous for montage is extraordinary the mood of this film is anger and it stirred my passions violently it takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film especially a drama but films like battleship potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it come on you owe it to yourself to watch this film your education is incomplete without it ,1
this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a film rouge the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have staged little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a study in red as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jean louis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape 9 10 on my personal scale ,1
paul verhoeven genius and master film maker strikes back with the less than perfect yet still fun in a dirty old man type of way hollow man the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it s mind blowing special effects perhaps the best so far around and two dandy performances by the leads verhoeven s moral questions are of course thought provoking and although the film turned off many this movie is pretty soft core for old verhoeven two major flaws josh brolin aka walking ape man and the whole deal with the elevator if there was an access ladder why were they trapped down in the lab a fun horror film for a saturday night ,1
like the other guy said it sux you can count the words that have been said in that entire movie on one of your hands too nudity she got naked like 7 or 8 times in a 1 and a half well past the nudity you ll find a porno behind that film he f ked her all movie long bad acting bad story bad language carmen was swearing all movie long so you get out of that movie pornografic scenes and dirty language a lot of gaps in the movie a big silence every now and then the only good thing in that movie is the beautiful places were it has been shot otherwise it s an hour and a half of your life that you ll gonna waste so if u gonna watch that movie good luck it really sux,0
after a quasi gothic all fruity music video the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll we don t live n that world the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence when i say clown i mean actual clown he tell them they re all going to die via cassidy s ghost the spirit possesses dora one of the band mates we couldn t care less as the characters are all boring vapid and extremely horribly acted written by adam hackbarth an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one and directed by corbin timbrook who after the attendant and tower of blood has to know that he keeps making crap for a living this movie s a constant battle between the film s incompetence and the viewer s need to stay awake not enough blood to appease gore hounds nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone my grade f eye candy amanda carraway gets topless where i saw it starz on demand,0
as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing this is not a film cue dramatic music it s just a so bad it s good totally surreal jackie chan stunt for all the women fighters are totally kick butt and jackie is definitely put in his place this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon surrounded by munchies ready to roar with laughter cheer on the good guys boo the bad guys and continually yell what when something totally bizarre happens great fun ,0
i haven t seen it in over twenty years oj was the bus driver arte johnson was the tour guide lorenzo was the kidnapper yea lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for oj who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing but also to see arte johnson i was a little bored that johnson was so serious and yes it shifted plots in reading other posts i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue i was going a stamp if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldn t be nostalgic over it not yet anyway there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out ,0
the student nurses is not a typical sexploitation movie sure the nudity and sexual openness is there but it s not all for laughs stephanie rothman scripted a socially compelling well written tits ass movie which confronts the topics of racism socio economic inequalities rape abortion medical ethics public health issues human rights the vietnam war free love lsd and drug experimentation four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing internships at the same time sharon elaine giftos is assigned to the terminal care ward lynn brioni farrell to public health administration priscilla barbara leigh to gynecology and phred karen carlson to psychiatry these four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate of which they take advantage much to the delight of male viewers these are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution after all and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful visceral yet low budget action sequences are interspersed throughout there s a very bloody gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed along with several members of the group an anti vietnam war protest consisting of spookily dressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent with cops beating protesters the effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper sensual overtones in short the student nurses is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times expressed through real women s perspectives since it was written and directed by a woman but it s still fun and titillating despite its sobering treatment of subject matter ,1
some people say this show was good in it s early years i disagree with all of em the show is just plain stupid and pathetic my mum hates it i hate it my dad hates it i don t know about my sister but oh well here some reasons why 1 the characters babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid the babies are just precocious and annoying the grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing the worst character is that angelica pickles she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long hard and miserable day at the office and also that kimi finster who appears later on she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt she can t decided whither she is french or japanese it doesn t matter know you are a american citizen know and that s that oh what am i talking about all the characters from this show suck 2 the stories the stories are unoriginal and dumb the make it like the babies go off on a great adventure yeah to the back yard shed in one episode that little goofy brat tommy pickles the leader broke in to a television s control room and literally almost destroyed it don t give kids any idea to smash up normal t v station s control rooms they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life i can imagine what the broadcasters must of felt like airing this episode they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will brake in sad 3 over rated the show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin offs for this get off the simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies the show is just plain over rated people where is your common sense anyway i surprised t v stations across the world want to air this series even off today the show is utter junk and should have never been produced the two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same 2 10,0
 lies tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes with very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama lies quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam with an almost 2 hour run subtitles and so little substance lies is simply not recommendable c ,0
ag was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising this show lived up to the gothic moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show this show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows which are so less than satisfying viewing the call for a dvd box set is well based this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing a public that is tiring of over saturation of mind numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling bring on the dvd box set ,1
no one can say i wasn t warned as i have read the reviews both user external but like most of us attracted to horror movies curiosity got this cat come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know that s horror aficionados are always dying to know what s in there even if we know it ll be bad the bottom line is that this movie left me angry not because it pretends to be real who cares gimmicks are allowed or because the actors and dialogue are so lame is this an unusual event in horror movies or even because the movie is so bad and i am being polite here what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp but also a half hearted lazy rip off at that i don t believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them but they didn t even try the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror or any movie ,0
after huge budget disaster films set in america like the day after tomorrow and deep impact it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like flood using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on england it was a welcome change of pace to seeing the empire state building being demolished however this is not a strong film on any basis whilst being fairly shocking seeing all your favourite london landmarks being demolished by a very fake cgi storm surge flood doesn t really deliver on anything else the performances are bland being saved from the pit of hell by david suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the deputy priminister he is perhaps a little too calm for what is going on in the film all that fake water gushing around london must have made him pretty annoyed it is understandable that the effects weren t going to be as good as tdat and di but the cgi was at best average bland disappointing and sometimes even tiresome watch it if you must but watch something else straight afterwards ,0
i really liked this movie but the ads i saw implied and one published review actually said that this movie benefits from a light touch that to me is very misleading there is indeed plenty of humor eccentric un subtle sometimes somewhat twisted humor the kind of humor i generally find very appealing indeed but most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious deeply sensitive even deeply painful the movie weaves together themes of past and present perception and truth memory and activity life and death the entire movie is suffused by the history of european anti semiticism in general and of the holocaust in particular how can humor and horror be combined in the same movie the review i saw suggested that the humor is absurdist i don t think this is the case at all at least not in the common sense instead i think this movie stands in the tradition of much jewish yiddish literature and theatre i don t claim to be any kind of expert in this area but from what i ve seen humor is used in this cultural context both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people and also humor is used as a means of recovering the divine for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or absurdism see fiddler on the roof for humor used in both ways in this rich tradition elijah wood jonathon wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look well strange compare sin city when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect in this movie it s easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth eugene hutz young alex and boris lesking old alex are both really just wonderful jonathon and young alex are from the same generation yet seem so very very different and then find that they are not so different after all and the way in which the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from that of jonathon to that of young alex as a journey of intended discovery for jonathon becomes one of discovery for both young alex and old alex is to me so very moving there are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from i m told prague and environs standing in for the ukraine of the story line all feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place although i ve never been myself to the ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experience all in all if you re looking for light comedy i would not recommend this movie at all on the other hand if you are interested in a wonderful delightful and deeply moving film please check out this wonderful movie ,1

if you have ever been has a friend or a kid that is or was into skating at one time then watch this flick i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place a long time ago it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn t understand why skaters well skate sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen which the movie does touch on slightly but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating just a person on a board doing it because they love to do it this movie was so inspirational to me that i m now skating once again i m 32 and i haven t been this happy with my self in years give this one a go you will not be disappointed ,1
now i ll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie that about sums it up too i disliked this movie to be more specific i disliked the concept of this movie the cinematography was good the mood was nice and the acting was satisfactory however the story is fatuous unacurate and misleading it is also offensive i am a quarter cree indian and for some reason i feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of whitaker s character first of all he s a black guy and this isn t a racist remark i swear the thought of a white hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents the katana represents the soul of a samurai imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a katana anyway it must be one of those replicas which insults the samurai caste even more also ghost dog showed no honor near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy it s more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists but hates none the less then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable he kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to bushido so we have great cinematography good ambiance and so so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it making it an unsatisfactory overall film and an insult to everything a honorable bushi samurai holds dear 2 5 10 bleah,0
sistas in da hood looking for revenge and bling bling except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s i do not remember any westerns like this when i was growing up what would randolph scott say if he saw lil kim he might say alright i have to admit that i tuned into this just to see her bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick but these are the cowgirls and they are fine now don t go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting and when s the last time you heard john wayne call someone dawg and i don t remember the earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the ok corral i watch this on bet so i missed the action that got it an r rating but i doubt if i will buy the dvd to see it unless i can be assured it was lil kim in that action ,0
nothing about this movie is any good it s a formulaic predictable romantic comedy geared to make females force their significant others to watch in other words it s a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable if you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect i was also forced to watch this with my g f at the time and it s no surprise we are no longer together i enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors nothing good to say about this movie the title says it all 1 10 one b c i can t give it a zero ,0
i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn t a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn t a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing ,1
walter matthau and jack lemmon both of whom are sadly missed proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen this film is just another example of this this time out they play two brothers in law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board of course their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named gil godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys it s hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat s owner rue mclanahan too bad that fellow dance instructors hal linden and donald o connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that matthau falls for dyan cannon on board with her fellow gold digging mother the usual outrageous elaine stritch unknown to them matthau has no money either the widower lemmon falls for gloria de haven looking lovelier than ever the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers ,1
i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in 45 years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years ,1
good lord this movie needs to have a new classification on its cover watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do i am disappointed i was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine but this movie didn t do it a reasonably good story but pretty awful acting dialogue and filming it was disjointed and sometimes outright silly we had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera people talking out loud by themselves and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen shadows of equipment in some shots silly clichés like i just need you to hold me in the totally wrong places and situations thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if i d offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money ,0
okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch it s about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac akshay kumar starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses there s garam masala at every step of the movie songs rock but somethings lacking the comedy s not up to the mark and deserves an award its nice but not all that excellent some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn t deserve that many laughs but of course everyone s opinion is different so if you wanna watch the movie you re welcome to do so ,1
i first saw rob roy twelve years ago with little money for entertainment i rented it for my fiancé and i to watch on a bone chilling winter s night the movie i had wanted was gone so i rented this instead not expecting much and was very much surprised with how good it was i just recently watched it again and loved it every bit as much as the first time for those unfamiliar with the story it s about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor a cattleman and folk hero from the little i know about the man and his story liberties have been taken with the facts but it s a movie not a textbook and so the filmmakers can be excused basically the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from but his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis and mary his wife suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of archibald cunningham a smarmy englishman with no soul atrocities ensue until in an immensely satisfying conclusion rob carves archibald up like a christmas turkey there are many great performances in this movie but allow me to touch specifically on a few liam neeson as usual is fantastic a sexy beast you can t take your eyes off of honestly this man is like ice cream even when he s bad he s good his rob roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him in the best way he knows how jessica lange as mary gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure you just know she doesn t take any b s from rob or anyone else for that matter tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald yet somehow it works all the posturing and preening combined with some wicked dialogue result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory combine all of this and the stellar work by other supporting players with the luscious scenery of scotland and you have what amounts to one really really cool movie if you haven t seen this i highly recommend that you do ,1
where to start oh yea message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed don t spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away don t sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you can t have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away time and motion doesn t work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn t have to brutally kill 4 men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home ,0
this italian semi horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them they show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience s business after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely this movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film explaining evelyn s death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull ,0
lindy meryl streep and her husband michael sam neill have just welcomed a baby girl azaria as seventh day adventists they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church with their two older boys looking on michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer s rock one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia not being wealthy the family camps near the site after a wonderful first day lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents suddenly she hears azaria crying as lindy rushes to the tent a dingo dog is just exiting shaking his head the baby is gone and soon so is the dingo although the entire camp looks for the baby she is not found concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child the chamberlains struggle to accept god s decision and go on with their lives but unfortunately the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby she is subsequently arrested and put on trial how could this happen this is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination the entire country turns against the chamberlains in part because they are seen as odd streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy whose own strong willed demeanor works against her every step of the way neill likewise does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael the cast is one of the largest ever with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy s case the costumes scenery script direction and production are all top of the line if you have never seen or heard of this film remedy that straight away it is not a far cry from reality to say that this cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media ,1
the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 now the daughter is 16 in season 1 and they live like sisters sharing everything trusting each other completely i like the gilmore girls but i am not sure why the mother named lorelai lauren graham and the daughter named rory short for lorelai played by alexis bledel are both very beautiful women they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways there are some funny supporting characters such as luke scott patterson he and lorelai like each may be even love each other but neither of them really acts on it they have their little moments there are some other supporting characters most of them very funny and with their won touching moments what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult the dialogue between them is quick sharp funny and sometimes touching as well the band they have is beautiful the gilmore girls makes you feel good so try it ,1
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards ,1
not much to say beyond the summary save that this is an example of j edgar s hoover s constant attention to maintaining a good pr profile they don t make movies this bad very often especially with the likes of jimmy stewart and vera miles in the blend too bad ,0
this is probably the best horror film made since ed wood died i can t spoil the ending because i have absolutely no idea what happened i ll try my best though there are some kind of lesbian vampires but they keep swapping bodies so any character might or might not be the character you re supposed to think it is or it might be a lesbian vampire sound confusing it s not as confusing as you might think since none of the characters make any sense to begin with there s no plot no character development and random people show up speak a few lines and then disappear never to be heard from again there are also zombies who are possibly the enemies of the vampires but there s also a dream within a dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital so maybe none of this actually happened and it s all the main character s hallucination the upside both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly the special effects are simply mind boggling i particularly liked the incredibly slow awkward fight sequences everyone has a really silly canadian accent which adds to the general level of hilarity well worth the price of rental we laughed until we cried ,0
this show paranormal state has an almost blairwitch project feel to it as in you re watching a documentary that s actually just a scripted movie made to look and feel like a documentary my biggest problem with the show is their go to outside advisers of the warren s who were made famous for their investigations of the amityville murders which were shown to be completely fraudulent just based upon the police reports of the family s deaths such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths then there s the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take they don t want to help those who need it most they just want the weirdest cases that will get them the most press and attention they re complete frauds plain and simple ,0
it s schmaltzy but then what else did you expect the heroine is cinderella s younger sister complete with wicked mother sister and brother in law the hero if you can call him that is an ineffectual putz and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy the cast settings and wardrobe were all very attractive and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was the movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout megon mcdonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments if you love danielle steel you will love this film if you love archetypal romance you will love this film i did not i was able to sit through it but it was close ,0
through the years i ve been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound indelible mark on the world my fascination has also been born of fear as in could this happen again and throughout the ensuing years yes i fear it continues to happen around us and of course it was happening long before anne the it of course is can a so called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent country race continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the flimsiest of excuses i leave that question out there at the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader adolf hitler in that the one profound fact about hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a compliant poodle press and fear mongering propaganda played over and over again for a docile population one of the atrocities was anne frank who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her diary s survival kenneth brannagh does a wonderful job on the commentary and interviewing he has that rare gift of minimizing his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselves many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the meticulous research which i will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the film glenn close reads selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part she brings a naiveté and freshness to the role old childhood friends of anne s are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality this is not to be missed a wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen anne 10 out of 10 ,1
i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn t make it to the end credits first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting lame sfx and extremely poor direction pales in comparison to the original anyone ever hear about the old et atari 2600 fiasco for those who haven t let me fill you in it s 1982 et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time atari decides to release a movie tie in game on their 2600 home console system to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari 2600 et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn t even give them away let alone sell them what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story look at the 3 2 rating and figure it out for yourself awful film imdb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn t go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives ,0
this movie was ridiculous from the start let me save you all time from watching this movie a woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes in her cousin or nephew and he convinces her to open a café downstairs from her home she does and she and the cousin become close there is a scene later where she is locking lips with him later the woman finds out an old boyfriend is coming back from jail and its tense between them leading to a down and out fist fight in the café the woman s cousin nephew is enamored by the man the ending was awful the story was awful and if i could get back the time wasted on this movie i would appreciate it a definite skip ,0
usual awful movie i ll not bother you about the synopsis just put together the core armageddon an evil planner military officer and one or two solve all nukes and you ll have the movie if i can call it that way seriously nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives the big one is approaching nuke some places and it s over a tornado wants to destroy insert important city name here nuke insert another important city here a volcano is erupting nuke it a nuke is near to go off nuke it coffee is cold nuke it you didn t like transformers nuke yourself but i can t assure this will fix things in the end how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke ,0
standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points number one lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning star making performance the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me sadly she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena carter s bland character sparkle whose rise to fame is easy boring and unconvincing however whenever the girls go on stage and perform the movie comes back to life the original music by curis mayfield must be praised the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape the picture quality was pretty low as well as the production values i m guessing all in all its worth a gander ,1
this is the movie that pretty much sounded the death knell for the auteur in hollywood at over 40 million bucks heaven s gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure what really galls me the most about it is that technically it s very bad an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it john hurt s commencement speech at harvard is inaudible as is a conversation between kris kristofferson and richard masur at the train station some people seem to think cimino intended this as a style he didn t it s just bad sound recording the characters are not particularly well drawn except for the four or five leads in the climactic battle scene it s difficult to tell who s the bad guys and who s the good guys even on that level it s impossible to enjoy the movie the casting of isabelle huppert as the town madam is a joke her french accent renders the whole character a fraud the acting is generally stiff without any range or depth of feeling even christopher walken is bad john hurt s character is the only one with any swagger or vitality although hurt in his 40s playing a fresh faced harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous i guess to say that it s overlong is overkill the roller skating sequence could have been easily cut the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the twilight zone having rod serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale actually those scenes in and of themselves are not bad but cimino has not earned the right to include them because what he s given us as the meat of the picture is so incompetently bad the editing is poor especially in the grand battle climax at one point the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times i wish could i say something anything nice about this movie a great scene a great performance even one memorable line of dialogue but i can t it is all just one big unholy mess about the only thing i did like was the cinematography and the montana locations which are stunning even cimino couldn t screw that up this is a long boring bad movie by all standards and the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves 1 2 out of 4,0
let me start off by saying that this doesn t seem or feel like a movie it seems like just another tv show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up the camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it this film takes us to where no movie i ve seen has done before to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation too obvious the large movie screen is only used as an enlarged tv from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner lately it seems that young directors are compromising the art of film making for sales this is very scary the industry is spoiling the art in movies we must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about not just sales and entertainment but a way to communicate feelings passions and even culture not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks ,0
terry gilliam s and david peoples teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the 90 s people s proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time i especially love the idea one can t change the past it s a nice counterpoint to so many time travelling movies which say otherwise biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness perfection and originality the story itself is engaging one man james cole played by bruce willis in a heart warming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that s wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information he ll collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface but because their time travelling technology isn t perfect he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists end of the millennium paranoia biological weapons the perception of reality and the definition of sanity with such a complex movie it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess but instead twelve monkeys is a thought provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas i watched this movie once around 10 years ago it marked me a lot i remember still thinking about many days after wards for my young mind this seemed quite mind blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important i ve re watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it s better than i remembered it brad pitt still steals all the scenes he s in playing jeffrey goines almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club a rich kid with some anarchist non conformist ideas who s also crazy and according to cole perhaps responsible for the virus the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie pitt s eyes voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he s really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands pitt s oscar nomination was well deserved surprising was also bruce willis performance his i didn t remember very well but it s beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground and when he comes to the past you ll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up cole is a rather ambiguous character peoples tried to imbue some darkness in him and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked ironically cole didn t start as a crazy character but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world he s considered mad and convinced it s all in his mind until he arrives at a point when he can t distinguish past from future reality from fiction willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure and it works perfectly one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole s shrink dr kathryn railly finds undeniable proof he s really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace their relationship is also well handed although perhaps a bit compressed for time s sake but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then things end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport wrapping all the pieces together which will blow many minds away there are two great endings in this movie a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who s just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who s witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look and she smiles at him the twist is brilliant but i prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine stowe is very good playing dr railly she drew many different emotions from me in her performance the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can t be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way it reminds me of chinatown in that sense the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help railly s character shares that fatalism the more she tries to help cole first dealing with his madness then helping him in his mission the more they re sucked into tragedy the twist ends with a hopeful note though with the feeling cole s mission hasn t been in vain twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained it s not supposed to be art although it s more artists than many artistic movies it s an unpretentious movie where all elements from music to editing to costume design etc came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece ,1

i don t know what it is with these brady kids first barry williams publicly brags about having sexy with his tv sister maureen mccormick then about dating his tv mom florence hederson then susan cindy olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies then mike bobby lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving finally maureen marcia mccormick and eve jan plum might have had a little same sex fling on the side now christopher peter knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early 20s during his stint on the surreal life which at first was fun to watch and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship the last episode where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to christopher for his birthday was not a good move on her part and he dealt with it in a very mature fashion just picking up and leaving to clear his head i think he was always bowing to her every need and now he s finally taking a stand and i hate to say it but i think she abuses him verbally the way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men which is not something any self respecting human being should do when already married to someone if this were a man talking down to his wife like that and going out every night partying and having sex with other people everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him why should this be any different what started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster adrianne as beautiful as she is is like another britney spears and lindsay lohan clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things i feel sorry for her but chris needs to rid himself of her because he is a good man who cannot afford to be humiliated like this ,0
you can take the crook out of the joint but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook we ve seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before and since in movies like bob le flambeur elevator to the gallows touchez pas au grisbi the anderson tapes etc too many times to mention what helps make this one one of the more notable is of course the heist itself which plays out wordlessly in real time and the demeanor of the lead bogart would think twice before crossing this guy the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story it almost demands it all around one of the better films noir ,1
this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable acting it comes across as a poorly conceived rip off of 2001 the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects but even that wasn t enough to keep me from nodding off i would like to get the soundtrack especially the music during the space flight sequence for nights when i have trouble falling asleep ,0
the release of tarzan the ape man in 1932 caused a sensation it may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix or the lord of the rings has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment tarzan became an instant pop icon the noble savage that every woman fantasized about and every man wished he could be the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs who while he d agreed to mgm s creative liberties and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks felt the dumbed down version of his character with no plans to allow him to grow was unfaithful to his vision he would start a production company and soon be making his own tarzan films mgm realizing the value of it s newest star knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original and tarzan and his mate delivered the film had an interesting back story cedric gibbons mgm s legendary art director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of tarzan the ape man despite the fact that he d never directed before the studio hadn t anticipated the film s impact and didn t think a novice director would matter much on a novelty film and they wanted to keep their oscar winning department chief happy gibbons a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of pre code hollywood and decided to have tarzan and his mate push the envelope to the limit tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim and jane would appear topless through most of the film maureen o sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did a couple of days of filming sans top but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples and the idea was abandoned the film shot those days would be worth a fortune she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her swim and donned a revised jungle costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sides and the resulting outcry would help create the hays office and the self censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry mgm yanked gibbons from the production the official reason given was his workload as art director and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director to appease the critics although james c mckay actually directed the film as conway was busy on 3 other projects including viva villa the film incorporated the best elements of the original safaris murderous tribes tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane and actually improved on the storytelling harry holt neil hamilton from the first film returns to africa for ivory from the elephants graveyard and to try to seduce jane into returning to england with gifts of silk dresses underwear and perfume he brings with him martin arlington paul cavanagh a crack shot and inveterate womanizer who sneers at holt s chivalrous pursuit of jane and stalks her as a potential conquest to be had by any means including killing tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seen tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane and puts his foot down refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard arlington finds his opportunity catching the ape man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the graveyard before her long voyage back to england comforted by the oh so sympathetic arlington but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group can tarzan being nursed back to health by his ape family recover in time to save jane while stock footage is again used extensively the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other tarzan film as well as a sexiness that even bo derek s blatantly erotic tarzan the ape man couldn t touch johnny weissmuller was in peak condition physically maureen o sullivan was never more beautiful and africa never looked more romantic and dangerous tarzan and his mate was a triumph although it would be drastically edited for many years and remains the classic of the series to this day ,1
i m glad this was the last of the 40 s universal mummy movies the movies were all of variating qualities and this movie was definitely one of the lesser ones problem is that it s a very slow moving movie in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is ever happening perhaps it would had all been better if the mummy had made his entrance earlier on in the movie instead now the movie once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had all happened in the previous mummy movies by also once again using archive footage from this time the mummy from 1932 again to which this movie is the fourth mummy movie following the 1932 mummy story the movie just never knows to find the right pace and even though the movie is barely over an hour long it still feels a bit like a drag it of course also doesn t help that the movie has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story the movie also feels quite disjointed the first and second half of the movie don t really connect to each other and they seemed like two separate movies on their own at least lon chaney jr is still in it he once more reprises the role of the mummy kharis for the third time too bad that he has such limited screen time this time he gets unfortunately very little interesting to do which is also a big waste of the mummy character itself the movie is further more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing around with silly accents it seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it actually gets quite distracting and annoying at points the mummy movies that s least worth seeing 4 10,0

before i see on this film i see a lot of comments which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad what i really want to point out is the acting on woody harrelson behalf he may not be in many parts of the film but when he appears or even the intro i was astonished by will smith s and woody harrelson message they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on i am not a very sentimental person i believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it but a act to show redemption there is not many films that in my point of view can show this this is one of them that can i agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of suicide is a downfall however i do not believe that is the message the film is trying to send but sacrifice a bit to the extreme but that is the message in my opinion this film has potential the acting it is worth every penny the script is unbelievable from a person that doesn t really like watching drama films if you like drama this is a must go watch ,1
what an atomic bomb of a movie the story goes nowhere and comes fron nowhere it leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying is this it what happened to redford he was once a fair actor now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it s a take wrong what an unemotional film i don t mean to be so so cruel but what crap of a movie unbelievable amateur crap if i was in this movie i would be so embarased that i would not show my face i tell you what if i was associated with this movie i am in big trouble this movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to ,0

1940 a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi occupied poland recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co operation of the jewish community is combined with archival footage clips from international newsreels and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the world s jews as swindlers and parasites this documentary interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti semitism and nazi ideology a candid cinematically unique expression of racial hatred i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again ,0
yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clichéd dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute it s a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare ,0
i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seen and to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shop my reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me again i doubt it they always say don t judge something by its cover they were right when i saw the cover to skins gang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars don t watch this film i can t think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad ,0
i wasn t at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit hostel and most of these lame ass knock offs are just as bad or worse yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a 7 foot leather aproned butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough hero with the guns and a grudge saving the day i would call this movie mediocre at best since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater doubling as a hideout for the mafia is appealing to me if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective then my rating would have differed greatly unfortunately most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge type scenario so basically it is just a low budget hostel rip off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex almost constant during the first half of the film overall i would say don t bother with this one ,0
i ve watched almost all of the gundam mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate old conflicts will end and new ones will arise to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting but how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot ,1

okay so i m not a big video game buff but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a movie from sure they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie as though justifying any particular scene of violence but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same with the hand in the bottom on the screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be it s an interesting premise in house of the dead with a lot of college kids loaded college kids as it were kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like 1 500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year the first thing that comes to mind about house of the dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations at least in this case the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops but at least they thought they were dressed for the occasion clint howard tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie i can t stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies it is so rarely effective and howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he s this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air he didn t even rasp well it sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something real tough there clint i expected more from him but then again he did agree to a part in this mess once we get to the island the movie temporarily turns into any one of the friday the 13th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed the nudity was impressive i guess but let s consider something for a minute these kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the rave of the year find no one and say well who wants a beer even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn t think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight here you have the input from director uwe boll there s alcohol they won t notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves so not only do they start drinking not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they re alone it s like they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some privacy since there s no one else around brilliant now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that i ve read about the movie yes intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie mostly in order to show that yes the movie was being faithful to directly copying the video game sure it was a stupid idea i can t imagine who thought up that little nugget but worse than that is the matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over after the first time at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film one of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out of places to run and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with the first two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and don t have a lot of places to run since they re on an island but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead then you have what i call the techno slasher scene since the rave never happened and i guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie there s one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video there s techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it s nothing but a blur of gory shot mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 1 6 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music clever i guess but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross out effect because you can t see any one thing for long enough to react to it you re just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie i ve seen a lot of people compare this movie to resident evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and they re exactly right i appreciate that at least here as was not the case in resident evil it wasn t some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires 28 days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie it s just too bad that house of the dead didn t do a single original thing except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i can t say that i know much about the game it s based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately i think that s more often the case than not with horror movies it s really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot which suggests the possibility of a sequel ,0
disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the mother s affair with her daughter s lover anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr jekyll mr hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic ,0
joe buck jon voight decides he s going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building there isn t much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck s plights in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybody s talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he won t and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers ratso s reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser ,1
first of all i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed the la punks i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80 s and that were not so easily achieved in finland so if you don t like this kind of music why you write here about it i like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus i know punks from all over europe americas so why do you who find this music repugnant care to comment at all ,1
i saw this film at the london premiere and i have to say i didn t expect much but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining the original basic instinct was no great film and is still something of a smut classic but it was entertaining i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it however this lame brain waaay belated sequel has nothing is sharon stone still gorgeous well let s put it this way for a 47 year old she s pretty hot is she as beautiful as she was in the original no she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing she doesn t look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress and whatnot the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible and michael caton jones a typically safe director one who doesn t always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and it s very clear from the start nothing makes much sense the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending oh my talk about stupid and unbelievable still predictable though i saw gigli i saw son of the mask and although i m not looking to smear this film i can say with my own authority which you don t have to agree with at all mind you that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure by the way stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy type nightclub basic instinct 2 basically it stinks too ,0
spoken like a true hard boiled u an gangsta the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii or goodfellas it is not in the same league but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u an accent pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia but their steenky accents spoiled the fun ah well the script ain t too hot either don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him smiling and patting him on the back all the while ,0
i m easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable i ve even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies there is only one movie that i ve seen that i can honestly say was bad and this was it it s been a while since i ve seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this it s honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend ,0
this movie had potential the script was not bad and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide patricide regrets and as chris says 10 years of going nowhere it s a sharp contrast to the original mag7 which was bright humorous and even the bad guy was lovable it s a very interesting change of tone and if they had developed the characters more maybe i would ve liked it but instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous and ridiculous battle scenes poorly edited together at one point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again but not many people would notice that since there are already 2 dozen horse trips i m not exaggerating and by then we ve already dozed off which leads me to the title of my review this film was extensively cut due to animal cruelty so chances are if you decide to watch it you ll get the watered down kiddie version there s a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull and suddenly as the crowd erupts cheering there s no bull just the matador in an empty arena like wow maybe the bull was a jedi i dunno more likely the scene was cut later there s a cockfight scene where in the original version one of the birds gets horribly mauled before a crowd of cheering mexicans this was cut but we still see enough to get pretty annoyed but by far the worst scenes are the horse throws one after the other you see horses legs get yanked sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head in one scene a horse gets thrown and then while it s squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions an explosive goes off right under its neck this film was made in 1966 when hollywood was just starting to regulate animal brutality on film this is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen so if that sort of stuff it floats yer boat check it out you ll get a mild thrill but if not you ll either be irritated or flat out bored ,0
i m not saying that just as a chris rock fan i m saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong the first flaw was it s everything works out ending that everybody saw coming flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between regina king and chris rock seemed fake finally the acting in this movie was sub par with the best actor being regina king and the worst being mark addy but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy in a heads up scenario watch heaven can wait instead it s better so for all you chris rock fans out there watch this movie you ll enjoy out he has some good stand up in this movie overall 7 out of 10,1
this is complete and absolute garbage a fine example of what a bad movie is like this can t be appealing to anyone not even b movie fans do not i repeat do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash bad acting bad directing horrible but i mean really horrible script and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment of any form is i bought the dvd for 3 dollars i swear i could almost pay someone to take it burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me i like b movies the killer toys the weird lagoon monsters but this is nowhere near you know those movies that are so bad they are funny not even just plain old pathetic ,0
let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlin s directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots unlike harlin s elm street 4 and die hard 2 which i really liked there is something that is missing from this movie that my friends is a script the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity there are so many awful lines in this movie i don t even want to have to remember any of them not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure it s almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said they could improve the script wrong again the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around lithgow turner and the worst of the bunch rooker there is something wrong with this picture lithgow played one of the best villains in ricochet yet comes across as someone who can t act to save his life here how is that possible i ve always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone who himself still phoned in his performance turner s part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen michael rooker can act i know this because i have witnessed it in days of thunder but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards has it come to this when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking i just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability unfortunately neither of those things occurred which brings me back to harlin who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters it s his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act the script is not very good but still the actors performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director i don t care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still can t just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene but i really didn t care if they got the money or not in that scene if the bad guy s would have won early maybe i wouldn t have had to witness one of the worst movies ever ,0
i absolutely loved this movie as a child i can t seem to find it anywhere i was mentioning it to some friends just the other day and not a single one of them remembers it can anyone help me out my older sister vaguely remembers it there was also another movie i remember that was half live action and half animation but i can t remember the name of it the characters were animated and the background was real i seem to remember it being about a kangaroo and i believe the setting of the film was in australia i m going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood edit i searched imdb for this other movie and found out it s called dot and the kangaroo all i had to do was type in kangaroo in the search bar under characters and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off man i love imdb thanks ,1
this film is a tour de force from julie taymor who directs and does the stage design and masks no one comes near to matching her imagination on the modern operatic stage since making this film in 1992 she has had much success in film making and in directing musicals one can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to opera one day i would love to see a ring cycle directed by her the current rheingold at covent garden has giants with over sized hands just like the characters in this film the current butterfly at eno uses japanese puppetry coincidence maybe or evidence that taymor s influence is pervasive taymar uses fantastical costumes masks puppets and origami birds to recreate the story of oedipus on a stage set on stilts above a lake red ribbons are a recurring theme they are used as an umbilical chord when oedipus is born they hang down from oedipus s eyes after he has blinded himself in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a crossroads when oedipus s slaying of his father is reenacted by puppets this neo classical opera ballet by stravinsky enjoyed justified obscurity until this film brought it to life the music is uninspired but inoffensive and philip langridge jesse norman and a very young bryn terfel make the most of it the singers are fairly immobile in accordance with stravinsky s wishes min tanaka is the dancing oedipus to langridge s singing oedipus this creates some slight confusion towards the end when dancing oedipus pokes out the eyes of singing oedipus the libretto is in latin but do not worry if your high school latin is a bit rusty there is a helpful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in japanese ,1
sloppily directed witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic 50s alien invasion films but really is no better than them except of course in the purely technical department good makeup effects and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail casino royale our man flint are worse than almost any james bond movie after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens you ll be begging for some peace and quiet 1 2 ,0
superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80 s exploitation hooray the pre credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we re dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we re up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister s naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesn t mind at all sick dude anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later they re facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue who s beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly and i won t reveal for what reason bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bo s principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film there s the obligatory we re falling in love montage and loads of other attractions my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie none ,1
the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor s revolt and the massacre at the town as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema it is also an example of szocialist realism by 1925 the soviet government actively used the arts including film as a means to spread the message of the revolution eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the battleship potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda ,1
mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere at what looks like a wooden building in the desert a pick up truck pulls up an angry father chucks his slutty daughter virginia monroe claudia christian out leaves her there but she isn t alone as the shadowy figure of nestor duvalier brion james watches her from a short distance virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her leopard print thigh high high heeled boots nestor grabs her by her throat drags her off into the darkness nestor then rips her top open turns into a monster starts to eat her innards virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant carlo hendrix art evans the lapd baffled or at least that s the message a local tv news reporter named clay dwyer mark thomas miller is telling his viewers clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth mcdonough therefore his mother emily jeanne bates has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the blind dark sunglass wearing nestor unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks nestor s sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes nestor then turns into a monster again bites emily turning her into a flesh eating monster just like himself nestor takes emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum rory vansaint murder him eat his guts but emily s son clay has witnessed the whole thing he must choose between doing what is right his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking flesh eating monster edited written directed by patrick rand i thought mom was a pretty awful film looking at some of the other comments on the imdb the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror well i can tell you now that i didn t see any comedic elements in mom at all because there aren t any unless they are very subtle the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesh eating monster the predictable problems emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out there are no jokes apart from naming a prostitute beverly hills stella stevens slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout it s 90 minute run time so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean there s lots of horror right wrong mom sucks is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of nestor turning into a monster a couple of times biting emily showing her how to hunt for food clay finding out until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some ok special make up effects had me interested unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by emily s son the eventual breakdown of his marriage him being torn between love for his mother the fact that she s a flesh eating monster this part of the film is incredibly slow boring as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role reversal scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room stay there locking the door behind her telling her off putting bars over her window so she can t escape her room mom s script totally ignores the monsters origins ask s us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped technically mom is bland cheap looking although i can t say it s badly made it s very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time the special make up effect s on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes blink you ll miss them don t be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was the monster is only in it three times maximum all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes there isn t much gore either a severed arm some brief intestine eating a burnt body a drill in someone s arm is all we get the acting is ok but please mr brion james what is that dodgy accent all about at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are nobodies expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night 1985 but you may recognise him from die hard 2 1990 he made mom die hard 2 in the same year talk about opposite ends of the spectrum overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film it certainly isn t a comedy as far as i m concerned very poor very disappointing yet again i ve been conned by fancy video box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters definitely one to avoid ,0
so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills natica jackson or power passion murder as it is called in holland when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality unfortunately it didn t 1 the plot of the film is really confusing there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film only they have nothing in common throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me but it still hasn t 2 the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson well it is sometimes like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice to conclude my story i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it by doing this you won t waste 90 minutes of your life as i did ,0
the ator series is a shining example of what b movies should be they fail in every aspect but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad ator l invincibile 2 aka the blade master aka cave dwellers shows us europe s favorite conan clone ator where we left him in the first movie after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film this time the world must be saved from the nucleus a kind of bomb represented on screen as a bright light i guess they couldn t afford a prop this one features invisible attackers and samurai as with the first film lots of stock footage is used including one rather obvious bit from star wars thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad this is an exception b movie ,1
fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by lou myers and brian s neighbor alex i giggled alot and even cried a little ,1
david burton richard chamberlain quite good is a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie nandjiwarra amagula uses a death bone to stop his heart meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock sized hail during bright blue skies with no sights of clouds such as the one that hits a school in central australia not to mention a deformed rainbow which is split into groups as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize one aboriginal named chris david gulpilil appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial he finds that it s quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it s story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film s most compelling angle is certainly david s journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn t commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later ,1
anthony wong plays lok a husband whose wife is seriously ill poor lok due to her illness he has been going without sex for a long time that s why he is plagued by a series of sleazy nightmares featuring nurses and schoolgirls erotic nightmare is a fun cat iii flick loaded with sleaze and voyeurism there is also a bit of gore as the first part of the film shows some nasty killings committed by wong character under the influence of the monk s mystical powers the dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy so i m not complaining of course those who expect gruesome cat iii horror in the tradition of diary of a serial killer or red to kill will be disappointed but fans of sleazy exploitation cinema should give this one a look 7 out of 10 ,1
investigative reporter darren mcgavin as carl kolchak is back this time he s after the night strangler once again police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve or want to cover up the supernatural angle producer director dan curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding night with understandably less success mr curtis assembles a fun supporting cast included are dark shadows alumni george dicenzo and ivor francis jo ann pflug as louise harper heads up a sexy collection of belly dancers and although i ve never seen it mentioned anywhere that must be roger davis as mr mcgavin s dining companion in an early scene feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires the night strangler 1 16 73 dan curtis darren mcgavin jo ann pflug simon oakland wally cox,0
i had never heard of this film until it came to dvd i was immediately intrigued by everything about it the actors the title the cover and especially the author arthur miller you can t go wrong with him can you yep i haven t read the novel but i m going to guess it was a lot better than the film i had high hopes for this movie i love macy and dern and it looked interesting unfortunately this film never really rises above cookie cutter messages about racism and bigotry if you ve never seen any other films that deal with this subject or if you never knew that america was founded on bigotry then maybe this film will wow you others will probably find it predictable stale and overall bland ,0
there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagal take my advice stay away from this piece of crap ,0
it is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie this one is no exception i am no lover of yanks but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white as well as make events even fictional ones in novels fit an agenda that bears little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme wilbur smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than has been delivered by this awful mishmash of a movie sad really for those who will never read smith they will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his egyptian series which has to be said is gigantic in its exposition the indiana jones movies were snappy to attempt to replicate that by manipulating smith s novels into this production misses out by a country mile pathetic except for the photography and art malik ,0
return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original it had black humor good suspense nice looking girls and of course a psycho killer what are we missing i think nothing except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television besides being one of the best sequels it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family recommended for everyone ,1
a review i have put off for far too long bluntly 2001 is one of the best science fiction films made to date if not the very best stanley kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works and although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and i ll have to agree back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since it was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why the film still looks marvelous after almost forty years take note cgi people through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid this aspect alone almost single handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects i can t think of another film where you can t here anything in space like it is in reality not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood and it works flawlessly aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film the music played all classical compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man s journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler the story while seemingly simple is profound sequentially several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film what are they where did they come from what do they do these are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way while most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions it s not left entirely up to interpretation but in some aspects it is experience it for more clarification the end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution while it is a long film and sometimes slows down it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man it s not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film faster paced feature those with short attention spans need not apply last but not least is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist hal 9000 the computer never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence which reminds me for a film with such profound ambition and execution there is surprisingly little dialogue another sign of kubrick s genius all in all one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made a personal favorite everyone must see this film at least once very highly recommended ,1
i thought this movie was awesome and the two guys nick and aaron are hotties i wish i could watch it over and over i loved the plot and whole concept of the movie it is great and i wish i had taped it last night nick i love you ,1
one of my favorite shows back in the 70s as i recall it went to air on friday or possibly saturday night on the nine network here in australia darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent to their credit the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which who came back as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the power beast amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames oh well you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best definitely deserves a place in tv s hall of fame to quote tony vincenzo kolchack you are on it or in the case of the hall of fame in it ,1
this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it s a very enjoyable light hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time highly recommended for it s feel good factor alone ok so frank sinatra s acting leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this his first venture into hollywood his voice not his acting is his main contribution to this movie i ve just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago ,1
whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn what s not known to today s audience is that libby survived until 1933 during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libby s point of view they could be understood and forgiven sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late 1861 while custer was still at west point i m not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby s farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivia s especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes don t moisten you are made of marble as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can t beat this film at all ,1
i was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham bad dialogue worse worst acting lifeless all the way and the cast knew it the two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life sparkle and were captivating ,0
just a comment on new orleans accents an earlier reviewer noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewer many people in new orleans do in fact sound broklynese i have never found out why it s mentioned in a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did too often it s just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent ,1
this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i ve seen but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i ve seen period it follows the lives of two sudanese young men peter and santino as they try to make their way into the american culture peter and santino are friends at first but they gradually drift more and more apart as peter goes to kansas city and santino stays in houston a land called houston santino s beauty is in his eyes he takes people onto his back he supports an apartment full of other sudanese paying the rent doing everything for other people he is a quiet sufferer peter looks out for himself getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends it seems that director megan mylan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale peter and santino are amazing characters that move you but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society it is not judging it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be to outside people i suggest you find this film and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people my grade 10 10,1
batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films its predecessor batman in my opinion is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre for one to say that batman returns was disappointing he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny devito as the penguin devito and walken offer some memorable moments the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays batman batman returns provides comic relief action suspense and fantasy and it should not be viewed as crap although we are all entitled to our own opinions ,1
alright a sci fi horror action b hybrid directed by jim wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people as with any wynorski flick he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don t lead to anywhere but storm trooper is more like a two movies for the price of one kind of deal on the one hand we got the drama thriller part as such the film opens with carol alt killing her incredibly annoying ungrateful husband a plot that simply leads to nowhere and on the other hand we got the escaped cyborg on a rampage part night of the living dead style with carol and the cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special ops bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies trying to break into the house needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest zach galligan of gremlins fame especially is painfully bad and corey feldman in a small supporting roll is once again completely wasted on this movie wynorski even rips off one of his own movies here since i am 99 sure he used some stock footage of his previous film 976 evil ii the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle yes it s so not good and so much fun this is strictly for wynorski fans only and i am one of them in case you didn t know already ,0
my take the silliest of the airport movies and probably one of the worst of the 70 s disaster movies as if to milk the franchise with all its got the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action silly subplots gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet concorde airport 79 is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970 s with its bad box office results it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000 but then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the all star cast which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars tv actors and none too popular b actors the plot is sillier than ever george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni now the pilot of the concorde co piloted by co pilot alain delon en route to france after the summer olympics on board is reporter maggie whelan susan blakely who has just discovered that his boyfriend renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison robert wagner is selling their weapons to terrorist to prevent her from revealing the news to the world harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing the cast subplots are dumber than ever even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition and the character doesn t go deeper than that j j walker a a pot smoking saxophonist arguably the most annoying character in the film eddie albert married to old wife sybil danning avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici much to the sour watching eye of coach mercedes mccambidge plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo and her pet chihuahua and bibi anderson camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick in the balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70 s disaster movies this one is in more than the sense of the word a true disaster rating 1 2 out of 5 ,0
i think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters is really funny you know the kind that you ll crack up on the ground and you ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks despite the bad acting bad cgi and bad story about cops going after a robot its really cool its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times there are so many funny parts like when kurt was trying to get edison s attention and gave him the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball on that part i kept saying remember remember to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought and kurt was talking about his strange dream and how he was superman i loved that part although it has been a while since i saw it so i don t remember that part everything the actors said were funny like how kurt says i worship you like a god to the robot although there was some bad things in all it was a great movie man i can t stop laughing i wish i had that movie ,1
well i guess i know the answer to that question for the money we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie i admit i thought the trailers looked bad but i still had to give it a chance well i should have went with my instincts it was a complete piece hollywood trash once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good must be good aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long it obviously started with a moth eaten script it s chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor and awful pastel sceneries it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction this is then compounded with yes i ll say it bad acting i couldn t help but feel like i was watching coffee talk on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either but mr myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he s ready to make another austin powers movie f no stars 0 on a scale of 1 10 save your money ,0
if you have read the book do not set your hopes high if you have not go read it and never watch the film it is strange to learn that toby young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script as he claims himself in the post script of the book because the film is very different from the book what the film seems to be aiming at taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it it achieves with perfection the film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had you are better off not seeing it ,0
here s a real weirdo for you it starts out with another take off on the psycho shower scene on campus then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean one of the college cuties wanders into the woods witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open then it s lets rip off macon county line time as dean stalks traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one tony march is on target as the evil shotgun happy dean the movie s overall tone is truly disturbing the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film it s also a study in despair shallow grave is a must for misanthropes misogynists and nihilists the world over ,1
brando plays the ace jet pilot just back from shooting migs down in the korean war on leave he discovers his madame butterfly falls in love the lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist conservative standards dominant at the time it was made in 1957 sayonara will make you laugh and cry beware though sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there although irving berlin s title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again ,1
anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal the author of the novel and screenplay to air her prejudices grievances and general antipathy towards the english the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight violent foul mouthed promiscuous engaging in child neglect stupid uneducated racist ugly eating poor food and dim witted tellingly only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be redeemed at the end of the film by contrast the indian family are beautiful clever educated can speak many languages are caring and loving parents and grammar school fodder the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all had it been the other way round an english family in an indian community depicted this way the film would have been seen as racist there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead i thought it would lodge in my hairline first the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration undertext the english are dirty and promiscuous and the men undertext english women are prostitutes second the meal with anita where neema s family lie to her about cutlery undertext the english are so stupid you can make them do anything but the underlying contempt towards anything english even english weddings are an object of scorn is evident all the way through the film the character of anita was drawn so appallingly almost the fallen woman trope that i finished the film feeling angry this is not a bend it like beckham where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community s behaviour and customs from somebody within that community and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together instead anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film s other community the english i felt anita and me is a hate filled grievance based piece of work on that basis the bbc should not have funded its production ,0
i don t believe this was an acting challenge for richard harris this was an uncomplicated plot yet interesting it is a good movie to watch when you don t want to do a lot of thinking just want to be told a simple story the canadian scenery was breathtaking the beautiful fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing ,1
director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known in his homeland at least for his japanese gangster films a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both shogun s samurai and battles without honor and humanity and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die and since so little is done to develop them their deaths have little impact when they do come this film has other flaws as well the makeup costumes and sound design are distractingly poor and the battle scenes were substandard as well inferior to other samurai films of earlier years seven samurai comes to mind sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in shogun s samurai the no nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film scowling menacingly what a guy he even gets to wear an eye patch if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune you may be disappointed his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting he disappears for good overall the strengths of the film are its story which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father who may have had some help on his way out early on it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn t be more clearly good and evil after all the older brother stammers and has a birthmark the sure sign of a villain eventually however it becomes clear that in a winner takes all struggle for power there are no heroes and villains only winners and losers ,0
although this film has had a lot of praise i personally found it boring there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable but the story of how they interrelate even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first as the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep one s eyes open for ,0
if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed i went to the cinema with a group of die hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn t as funny or dark as the three series before in my personal opinion it was a money spinner the writing was contrived and the plot confused no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do it was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series i will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia ,0
i remember watching this for the first time in the 80 s as a teen man i ve read the reviews on this trash and i find myself astonished by the voting this movie does not deserve four stars this movie is not better than topgun topgun has its own problems don t get me wrong this movie should be banned just for its own stupidity so many stereotypes so many loop holes so much poor dialog i cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit this is not action adventure this is a bad joke on film kinda like watching plan 9 with stock f 16 footage this movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context of a military setting it sends a disturbing message the military is not going to save your dad from the imminent evil of the middle east b ds so go out there and hijack a multi million dollar weapon and blast him out of the sinister clutches of the backwards anti american arabs cuz you can t reason with those animals this is a bruckheimer flick without a budget bland direction weak acting lame music idiotic plot equals iron eagle ,0
i got this movie in the 5 bin at walmart i would not recommend watching this move i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie it s just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam okay here is my rant about this movie to me this movie is slow and hard to watch it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end it doesn t after the movie was over i through it behind my t v because i was angry that i wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it ,0
so i turned on the tv today at 1 00 pm on a sunday expecting to see crap and infomercials and this great movie was just starting didn t know what it was but drew me in almost immediately the movie was excellent there were a couple of things that didn t make sense for one i don t get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation but then jimmy doesn t really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation in other words it wasn t his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck second i don t get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing panda s money and then the other thief kills panda at the end so they steal his money twice and kill him how is that good ,1
never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one i would love to own it i watched it every sunday they played it on the family film festival it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful ,1
this film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes whether they are wearing clothes or not the strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of shakespeare as joseph papp discovered back in the 1950s in central park shakespeare s plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present and so the classic tales of cross dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as twelfth night and a midsummer night s eve and as you like it are used to good effect in this film all the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes and the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of bend it like beckham another charming coming of age movie ,1
just after watching the first one and it is very dumb i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour the 11th hour should be embarrassed it is so weak stewart introduces himself as a government scientist no mention of what kind of scientist just general sciency stuff in a program about cloning they bring a caretaker who was paid to dispose unsuccessful embryos to a church and made him kneel before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on now thats science at work there is a dumb not good dumb bit where picard rages at a tv that advertises skin scream that makes you look younger shouting it s a lie as his randy female assistant gets groped by the local hot bobbie next door the end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named after pinnochios daddy in order to move the clunky plot along waves at picard from the street as she gets in a taxi picard is one floor up and he looks out a window wistfully going she got away he could like try to run down or maybe ring the cops or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending mahhahahahah pity it s so stupid at one point a grieving father is convinced by picard that even if a replica clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul yes that s right folks the general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone although the general scientist picard finds cloning a bit gooey he s all up for stem cell research and goes as far as to say that calamity will befall humanity if it isn t allowed he has a pretty strident rant about how important it is of course he doesn t mention a single example that kind of sums up the show buzz words and tawdriness :(,0
renee zellweger is a kansas housewife whose domineering husband is mixed up in drug trafficking two professional hit men morgan freeman and his son chris rock murder the husband in his dining room zellweger unobserved by the killers witnesses this and undergoes a dissociative reaction assuming the personality of a nurse the eponymous betty who is a character in her favorite soap opera believing herself to be the tv character zellweger takes off in her husband s car which has a load of dope in the trunk and travels to la where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama dr david ravell greg kinnear not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men she drives to la where she manages to link up with kinnear and is actually written into the show as a nurse named betty a handful of men in the know including the local sheriff catch on to what s happening and also seek zellweger in la the ending is believable and poignant if that sounds crazy it s because it is and it s the writer s responsibility john c richards the curious thing is that richards and the director neil labute with considerable help from the performers just about pull it all off this isn t a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold nope i give it bonus points for sheer originality somebody went out on a limb somebody took a chance on a movie that was not a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago i imagine the people involved down on their knees every night praying fervently i don t know if the film was remunerative but it s mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms it s what might be called an initial premise movie you start off with a single transformative event in this case the murder of zellweger s husband and her adoption of a genuinely new personality and follow the resultant logical paths realistically groundhog day is another better and more intricately plotted example nurse betty has its logical cracks where the incidents give up their plausibility eg at a party in la zellweger finally runs into kinnear the guy who plays her ex fiancé on tv she s stunned because after all she thinks she s betty who lost her fiancé long ago she approaches kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as nurse betty the character she addresses kinnear by the name of his tv character david ravell the group are puzzled at first then convince themselves that she s an aspiring actress who insists on staying in character during the conversation and afterward too after kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others bored kinnear drives her home and even when she kisses him goodnight she s still in character leaving kinnear wide eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures the character of betty on the next date kinnear returns her love that development the relationship between zellweger and kinnear at this point is a crack in the logic the kind that s absent from groundhog day by the end of night one kinnear like any other person would realize that zellweger is a few clowns short of a circus the rest of the film which includes many digressions succeeds beyond expectations the relationship between morgan freeman and his insolent nihilistic son is marvelously spelled out morgan is flawless in his exasperation he manages to fall in love with the image of zellweger as he unearths clues to her whereabouts and activities and at the end he can t bring himself to shoot her she s too sweet to shoot after her transformation into betty she left a note behind in kansas i want to help all life whether it be animal plant or mineral who could harm the author of such a preposterous connative statement his admiration of her comes as an epiphany as he stands near one of the floodlights at the rim of the grand canyon zellweger dressed as dorothy or maybe the good witch of the east well characters that like zellweger are from kansas anyway appears to freeman and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly it s a scene that s at once eerie romantic and a little spooky i once stood at one of those lights and threw some shredded paper into the updraft from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had misperceived the fluttering shreds as moths right where was i okay i was trying not to run out of space zellweger s performance deserves plaudits everything she does every movement every utterance is naive and tentative she really is a likable character and that despite the fact that she s no glamor girl by hollywood standards but what an actress compare her performance as the bumptious 19th century hick in cold mountain just the opposite but then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film allyson jannings does a fine job in a minor role watch her when she tells greg kinnear that she s considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident kinnear is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of ten thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time he chuckles and says oh one of those castaway deals right okay how do i get back jannings doesn t answer she just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly not a masterpiece of film making but a good original professional job by everyone concerned ,1
this is an astonishing film a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs everything in it is beautifully filmed the women the apartments but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images almost every scene has echoes of another this is a story told in light in colour in many almost parallels every time i watch it it fills me with delight the acting is great too romane bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown everything about her changes with her mood vincent cassel plays a very different role to his part in la haine but no less excellently shifty and sympathetic at the same time and monica bellucci ah monica bellucci well put simply she plays is the world s most perfect woman there s one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile yet in that instant says more than hours of hollywood junk one cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax sad shocking ironic and subtle in turn but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work it s the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story yet when the moment comes it is handled so delicately so briefly so deftly that on reflection it makes you gasp only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point but the confidence is justified cinema doesn t come much better than this ,1
i saw this movie once a long time ago and i have no desire to ever see it again this movie is about preston waters a hard lucked preteen who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash all this changes when a bank robber runs over preston s bike and passes him a blank check as compensation preston uses the check to withdraw 1 million from the bank ironically the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check preston then buys a mansion and says that he s working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr macintosh named after his computer after that he just goes crazy with the money on paper this sounds like a great idea however on screen it is one of the emptiest movies i ve ever seen for one thing it s too unbelievable i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible but i draw the line at a twelve year old boy going out with a thirty year old woman and being put in charge of a imaginary person s small fortune also this was a shallow movie with weak acting a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable the characters were either cheesy over the top annoying or underdeveloped but juice was a funny character if you re looking for a good movie to watch with your family skip this one ,0
being a genre film fan a child of the 80 s and a fan of hard rock music this movie holds a special place in my heart it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie action great special effects for 1986 and a guitar wailing glam rock soundtrack it certainly was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time i didn t see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here but it s popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it s cult status and eventually led to a sadly mediocre dvd release in 2002 if you re not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn t your cup of tea but trust me there are worse films of this type out there and despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations trick or treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare you ll never look at your stereo the same way again or should i say mp3 player trick or treat trivia marc price eddie played geeky skippy handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom family ties after a string of direct to video flops including little devils killer tomatoes eat france and the rescue he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand up comedy recently he has been considering a tv comeback glen morgan roger is now a major hollywood producer screenwriter he has written and produced several major films and tv series including space above and beyond the x files final destination jet li s the one willard and most recently final destination 3 tony fields sammi started his performing career as a dancer on the tv series solid gold he appeared in several low budget films and tv shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish sammi curr in trick or treat sadly tony passed away on february 27th 1995 of aids related cancer doug savant tim is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething matt fielding on the popular sitcom melrose place since then he has had a long and varied acting career appearing in such films and tv series as the one godzilla csi crime scene investigation and the short lived joss whedon sci fi series firefly currently he can be seen as tom scavo on the smash hit series desperate housewives ,1
if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children if you ve seen the movie you know that is no longer the case this movie was horrible main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out 15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute i wish i had never seen this movie it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left do yourself a favor go see something worth your money cause it s not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back ,0
what we ve got here is a situation a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him in contrasting ways at the end they are forced to let it go you can t fix people and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood that message isn t this story is not about charlie fineman adam sandler a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9 11 plane who s gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since it s about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson don cheadle a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and knowing about his tragedy spots him on the street and reconnects charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair the hair is sandler s chief prop to show he s deranged and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod wielding subway rider charlie is a disaster but paradoxically alan stuck with a controlling wife jada pinkett smith soon begins to envy him charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund insurance money from the tragedy and starts dragging alan off to hang out eat chinese buy records or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady redoing the kitchen over and over collecting old vinyl of springsteen the who etc and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room charlie s in laws are deeply concerned about him but also somehow resentful as we learn later alan has a new patient who is propositioning him charlie s desperation makes us see alan s trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them cheadle and sandler make an odd couple but that doesn t matter because it s convincing that they might both need each other charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family because to escape his loss he is pretending he never had one and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste no motown alan wants an escape from his tidy emasculating life he s under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners who lord it over him though it s he who set up the practice they re white by the way and he s black there s also the lascivious patient from hell who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she s a babe his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute he s also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help sandler s mad scenes are a little too theatrical as are a lot of the plot devices in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching charlie s not just delusional and sad but dangerous and violent and all these efforts to help him start to backfire the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can t be made right this is an interesting movie sometimes a touching one and it s the first time 9 11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times many of the people are too broadly drawn and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful décor only the manhattan streets look real there s a courtroom scene that is preposterous and donald sutherland is a judge who s too good to be true alan s family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call and yet this is worth watching for the acting the control and subtlety of cheadle and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p t anderson s 2002 punch drunk love though that s clearly a better movie in fact a much better one ,1
 hardbodies 2 is harmless aimless and plot less i would add brainless to that list but the movie within a movie gimmick although not done very well helps it to narrowly escape that label the scenery has changed from the california beaches to the greek islands and the only returning cast members from the first film are sorrells pickard the bearded guy and roberta collins who at one point falls into a mud pit bringing back memories of her classic catfight with pam grier in the big doll house all the other actors are new but apparently brad zutaut is supposed to be playing the same character scotty as grant cramer did in hardbodies this sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie and doesn t come close to matching it in the hotness department either of course brenda bakke and fabiana udenio are both very pretty but the teal roberts cindy silver kristi somers team is unbeatable hardbodies 2 is not the worst of its kind by any means but if you only want to see one of these movies the original is the one to get 1 2 ,0
this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it s watchable and rather funny i don t think the film makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it s just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it s the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it s own this film is really stupid but it s funny the killings are hilarious i wouldn t advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked good but if it happens to be on tv one night and you re up for a laugh then stick it on ,0
great premise poor execution cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written poorly directed poorly edited waste of film only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food joan chen mercedes ruehl kyra sedgwick and alfre woodard should fire their agents ,0
seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn t quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrown in oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the one liners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it s welcome as it turns into the worst action movie ever lungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van damme s movies seagal s movies and stallone s non rocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carrere s face when she is in any scene with dolph that s worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lee s comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the 13th because of the senseless nudity and lungren s performance is very jason voorhees like in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie the good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungren s sidekick and doing a really awful job at that an awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non underwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight scene ending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill in between the flashes of nudity a bad bad movie ,0
bon voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome most importantly though the film is also historically instructive it captures the tension of the so called phony war and later the french aristocracy s flight from paris ahead of the german onslaught yet bon voyage is not a war movie it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times bon voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of french reactions to the new political order this film is a comedy which entertains the audience a romance which skillfully utilizes many clichés and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them ,1
i kind of liked the film it s just that the characters run around with no real point to their craziness as i was saying poor goat the goat was nahing while the guy was pretending to grind on it i would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic not the one with the goat though jane ryall who played celia only did this one film she was very nude throughout this crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places i almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners if you like crazy off the wall stuff then this is your film 3 10,0
most films are crappy with high production values this one is crappy without high production values which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn aselton who i believe if given the proper script could probably turn in a pretty good performance she plays emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus josh who often refers to her as dude or man in a non ironical tone but heres the thing emily is a semi believable character which means rhett will soon need to be added to the cast to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh when we first meet rhett we learn that he is deep because he is videotaping a lizard which is proof that he sees the world uniquely rhett then shows the tape to emily and in one of emily s few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy haha this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome i believe sxsw gave this film some minor award oh south by southwest why do you encourage them its only cruel but here is where i hand this film a compliment it is the best of the mumblecore movement mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting but still its good to be the best of something i haven t seen baghead yet but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward the preview at least made it appear tolerable where as even the puffy chair preview couldn t really hide the fact that it was going to suck i ve gotten off topic here anyways rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all much like josh most likely isn t an actual actor but rather the director or brother of director there s some mixed messages there i think rhett was somebodies buddy and they said hey why don t you play this guy named rhett in the movie the fact that rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same unless i am mistaken which i am not if rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive so anyways rhett emily and josh team up to bring the puffy chair to rhett and josh s dad some stuff happens along the way more bad acting bad supporting actors crappy camera work an attempt at significance this film wouldn t have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance the whole thing is amateurish if you can view this movie without paying for it like if its on tv or for rent at the library then consider looking at it just to see if you like this super cheap style of film making i like what the duplass are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see ,0
 the seven ups seems like a replay of the french connection which was released two years prior both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances as well as stunt driver bill hickman but we aren t dealing with french drug baddies instead we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum we get to see unpleasantness and a pre 1990s new york city i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action and it is a reminder of a cooler time that said when one compares the car chases mr hickman had involvement in the three most compared this movie bullitt and the french connection each chase scene has its own qualities and this one is simply superb and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd ,1
 tip have it read to you heres how 1 copy and paste this to notepad not word 2 go to start all programs accessories accessabilty narratorhaving your testicles ironed when jonathan ross started his career he was on a show call the last resort now a days he is the first resort to host anything and anything tv award shows that half the time he is up for nominations in comic relief chat shows quiz shows game shows charity shows brighton just when you at you wits end and think you can find salvation in the wireless the lisping twang of good old j r hits you like a freight train going none stop from texas to downtown n y that has lost a hour and is trying to make it up about this show fnwjr its a normal chat show format with j r as host and a house band that concisest of four gay men ha ha ha ow my aching sides and season one had andy davis but he left or was fired to give way to ross s ego ross will more less use his guests as props and you really don t hear them speak because of his its my ball and i ll take it home attitude you also see that the bigger the guest the more he is willing to lie and suck up to them to get in with the big boys like the weak kid at school who hangs round with the bully however when a small reality t v star comes on he ll happily humiliate them asking personal questions about the past and telling them about their lack of talent to get the laughs sometimes he will under estimate the popularity of a guest say something to belittle them and then when the audience act shocked he will quickly turn and start making himself the fall guy the best example of this was when life on mars star john simm came on and he said how does someone like you get work your ok looking but not hollywood good looking bare in mind the hugh jackman and halle berry was in the green room he was really only trying to suck up to them before they were even on the couch when the audience acted shock ross quickly said what i m bit light headed from wearing that corset i don t know what i m saying if he don t have any low forms of tv life on he ll just dig at the four gay men on the piano with jokes more out of date than his fashion its very much a different story when a hollywood a lister or big tv star comes on the show in that he ll tell them stories to humor them when some actor explains that he was in a support band then jonathon ross will say something like wow well he ever i go to see a band i was try to look interested for the support band to make them feel as though they are wanted with an underline message being please like me i was probably one of the people that cheered you when you was in your band top this off with an audience of ross fans so hooked on every bad old joke and bulling it really makes for a poor show your better off watching us chat shows instead they are more scripted but not anywhere near as hard to watch ,0
this movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle fits very frequently the characters in kadosh are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing very intense unhappy faces very pensive very serious during these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make doublely sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games the more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares we learn that the women of the kadosh community have two duties one is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands the second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work what do these men do with their ample free time they pray and we learn that at home they pray out loud i give you thanks for not creating me as a woman and at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics screaming and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre or simple but just as odd ritualistic activities the cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex the imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his beanie from falling off his scalp is unforgettable every sex scene is funny but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife s yaël abecassis feet oh yes we are finally entering the land of sensuality but no the feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends there are three attractive females in near states of undress however kadosh contains absolutely no nudity technically there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director for a more believable educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings i suggest barbra streisand s yentl ,0
ok i just have 3 words cheesy cheesy and cheesy the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain other than that it s cheeseball supreme the movie does have some promise in the concept an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon basically giving us more of jurassic park meets reign of fire there are some great possibilities but they just don t follow through the special effects are decent even though you know the dragon is cgi it doesn t horribly look like cgi i wouldn t lay the blame on dean cain although he is one of the producers i d lay more of the blame on phillip roth the director and writer it s his job to make this film and unfortunately he failed ,0
who doesn t love the muppets impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside so i guess what s important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special i don t remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly in fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self conscious in any bad way refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique the magic transcends all that other stuff tis indeed what movies are made of so how does the film achieve these things hmmm nice question stumped am i let s see really i feel like it s quite simple the filmmakers believe in their material and don t take themselves too seriously in the process i probably wouldn t say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack a zest you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren t afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance maybe i don t feel i have much to say about it because i was half asleep when i saw it and or as i write this review anyway i m sort of semi repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had full of love i suppose you might say again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly and to repeat myself once more one of the film s best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being like a butterfly so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that anyway if that sounds sappy i also reckon it was pretty hilarious so all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to plus it features lots of great music highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart ,1
caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack but there are legitimate reasons for it 1 rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn t like the script wanted to change it his request was denied so he didn t do the film 2 it was low budget bill murray had grown to superstar status ted knight passed away in 1986 and chevy chase the so called ace of the first movie although it was rodney all the way couldn t t be on more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him but you had dan aykroyd robert stack randy quaid and jackie mason all serviceable substitutes who none had their best performances ,0
my eyes in the name of god and all that is holy make me unsee this movie what drugs are you people on this could very well be the worst movie ever i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster from start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema when i thought to watch this movie with my jewish best friend and his family we thought oh hey this may be funny it will probably be bad but still a little funny how wrong we were we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be all of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over and during the course of the movie one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon i wish i had watched the video from the ring instead that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days for all who wish to see this movie you are not prepared you may think you are some sort of tough guy by renting this but this movie will break you push you to the ground and urinate on you ,0
budget decent actors who knew these things were important don t waste your time on this piece of junk the effects are crap the acting is crap the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap t a and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before hats off if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn t come from frogballs community theater ,0
featuring some amazing and wonderful characters a new mythology superbly designed and executed sets nightbreed is a great film sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting another idea would be the foundation of the new midian perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus ,1
i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that s not true the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever the american cop has a german accent the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet this cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isn t sure if that is what s happening because he s a moron the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the cop s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesn t know what is happening the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldn t take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won t waste anymore time on it writing this review absolutely worthless ,0
when you think of golf movies you think of caddyshack but what if there are kids around go right to this movie disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy the acting in this movie in my opinion is quite good and the leading cast for the most part is very young this movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique seeing all the angles of the golf game i think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch though the ending might be a little predictable the movie does well on its own it also shows that you do not need swearing nudity or violence to make a great golf movie ,1
this 1955 producers showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast including kathleen nolan as wendy who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play it s a shame that most people won t sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production which doesn t even show up in the imdb listings when you put peter pan into the search engine is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b w producers showcase televised version as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo how far away the 1950 s seem now such an innocent time compared to today i miss it ,1
another raquel welch classic this picture hit the theaters november 10 1969 starring raquel welch as michele james stacey as joe and luke askew as alan morris nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends michele and jackie while on her way there she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees michele and jackie alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back nikki is taken to the hospital while michele and jackie go to the police station michele goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that nikki died alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run michele down michele jumps into her car and heads for los angeles when she gets there she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see jeri about a job however there s one problem the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk back in los angeles michele not only gets a job as a dancer with jeri but also hooks up with jeri bouncer joe now some thoughts on this picture this picture was far better then raquel last and this one had nonstop action luke askew did a fine job of playing nikki ex husband he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it as for raquel welch performance the only word that comes to mine is fantastic she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking in fact all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking of course it doesn t matter what raquel had on because she looks good in everything or nothing i give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons the first and by far is raquel welch who s the leading actress and deserves 10 stars the second reason is that this movie was wall to wall excitement from beginning to end ,1
one word supurrrrb i don t think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re runs i have to say i had my reservations after all critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show but when half an hour was over by the way thank you nbc for running a commercial free show i was left with the feeling of instant love love at first glance the true love that one feels in his guts everything about this show screamed excellence graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek no small feat considering those movies took years to be developed cast was marvelous i am partial to john goodman s voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john special mention lisa kudrow s guest appearance she was on top of the game creating neurotic pudgy and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her panda from brooklyn only in this show script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky a note for all parents this is not for children this show was never advertised as such and there s a reason why it s set for 9pm not 8pm so if you d like to complain about objectionable context save your breath adults deserve a comedy made just for them and father of the pride is it not everything was perfect i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy s characters do i sense stereotype when it comes to them yes they are gay yes they are flamboyant yes they speak with german accents but that s yesterday s news give us something new something fresh something funny putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have that s fine by me but please don t dwell on something everybody already knows by heart hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over in general the show is definitely a must see tv funny witty with a few unexpected twists here and there there haven t been a comedy this good since seinfeld i am certainly looking forward to the next episode ,1
this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a belgian francen a greek paxinou and a hungarian lorre and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat despite these absurdities the performances are all very good especially those of paxinou and lorre but the scene in which boyer paxinou and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn t find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as mata hari dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican ramon novarro maybe they should have got novarro for confidential agent he would have been great in boyer s role or at least in francen s which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget ,1
 dead letter office is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service struggling to rebuild their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the links between the characters past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over schematically represented what s most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the film s title there s no mechanisation whatsoever and it s quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed it s a shame as the film s overall tone is poignant and wry and there s some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasn t actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else ,0
this movie was flippin awful i wanted those hours of my life back for god s sake stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs its not worth mentioning the title but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this and where do i begin the dumb a kids in the movie the zero plot or story the garden variety college frat boy esquire scenes of towel slapping or the very bad acted teen angst innuendo my god it never ended i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor then sit through this one again but what do you expect most people with the brain power to look up reviews are not going to be the target audience here at all so go see pirites 2 again or the jet lee one if your debating to yourself look this movie will just cost you your soul your money your energy and your brain cells heed the warning ,0
i love tudor chirila and maybe that s why i enjoyed the movie so much two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert i saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i assisted a great one i felt the movie it was sad it was funny but most of all it pictured love i can t even begin to describe the soundtrack so i won t i m not a movie critic i can t describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard thank you tudor giurgiu thank you maria popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila encore :) :) :),1
in one of neil simon s best plays creaky cranky ex vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they haven t even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters ,1
wow i m a huge henry viii tudor era fan and well this was interesting the only one i watched was the catherine of aragon one and wow just wow i ve seen bad acting before but this reached new heights when the actress who played catherine was umm crying she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times many many times funny funny stuff the only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing anne boleyn i might be prejudiced though i do have a slight obsession with anne boleyn she was a really facinating woman read up on her it s worth it also i have read a lot about the tudor time period and i think that the characters weren t very acurately displayed they were all very stereotypical only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock ,0
all movies that contain goofy sound effects should be shot if there is one thing i hate it s gotta be the use of a whoop whoop whoo when somebody gets hit one the head the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because she never really hits him with it yes ghoulies iv does suck but i have to wonder did they mean to not make the so called ghoulies mouths move when they supposedly talked their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls 2 hell i can make a better mask out of construction paper some rubber cement and a handful of glitter this sucked ,0
i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is suffice it to say anytime i m depressed about how unfair or futile things seem this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result persifina the laundry co worker of ruby s ashley judd is another her eyes and smile could make the hardest person s day i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends and i realize that being alone ruby is alone quite often isn t the same as being lonely recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie ,1
what a waste of great acting talent this is a shame because with catherine deneuve mathieu amalric emmanuelle devos chiara mastroianni and melvil poupaud not to mention others less well known in america that s a lot of acting talent to waste this film by arnaud desplech was a terrible disappointment after having enjoyed his kings and queens and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where i actually left before the movie ended the movie wandered around its central storyline involving catherine deneuve s illness getting sidetracked by every peripheral storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen the movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much this was a story of family dysfunction so that the dearth of coherent narrative became even more critical finally the soundtrack which ranged from hip hop to bach to mendelhson s midsummer night s dream was at odds with the emotional temperature of the movie and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time the photography the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen where our only sight is through a small opening making feel as if we are watching through a peephole that then expands was also pretentious and inscrutable ,0
i have seen this movie and the other one trinity is my name and i find that this one is worse then the first one i have no idea why they even made another movie it was stupid and pointless sorry to say that i have all of them i have sat through them number of times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie i like terence hill movies and i like bud spencer but this movie just drove me up the wall if it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies but you make mistakes so i would say save your money and don t bye this movie or any of the ones that go with it trust me on this one ,0
 ninja iii is not quite as bad as enter the ninja the first part of this trilogy but it s still a very bad movie it will hardly please the fans of martial arts movies because there isn t enough action but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence as if the film wasn t already weak enough the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic the exorcist rip off the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the dominated heroine she is a beautiful and athletic woman which the director doesn t forget to exploit in various sleazy ways she just happens to be an aerobics teacher i don t mind a little soft core exploitation but it must not pretend to be something else ,0
watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one s mind movie starts with abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn t leaving soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don t have any thing to live on here in this situation abahy turns out to be a helper for her this is the base of story the rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat dialogues and music are good songs are ok direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts my rating for this is 8 10,1
this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen on a par with blair witch and just as annoying the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying i think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something she can really hear something one of these guys must have at least seen scream where they draw your attention to such things it is also a big let down when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back ,0
i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together by the filmmaker s own admission on the official site the short was exhibited as a rough cut but nonetheless it was an easy going comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh that s all i did just that at its showing so it succeeded on that level just my 2 cents anyway ,0
this show is awful how is george wanting the death of his mother funny this show is terrible the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat george isn t funny especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish ernie is a loser but at least i ve chuckled at him a few times but mainly at how pathetic he is george s mother benny in an awful despicable character sure her husband left her but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me can someone explain to me how george s head being big is funny it s not even that big i ve moved on from characters because they re too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i frankly don t care enough i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time i give it 2 starts because the wife is extremely attractive ,0
spoilers this review has been edited due to word limit the horror the horror marlon brando apocalypse now 1979 and apocalypse now redux 2001 the sentence which is as famous as here s looking at you kid or are you talkin to me or may the force be with you or i ll be back means a little more than some one liners when it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed what might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame what exactly does this line of dialogue mean the horror spoken of is the reality of war the reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt when capt willard martin sheen stands before the dying col kurtz marlon brando at the end of the film the horror the horror is the realization of willard s corruptness he has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment this isn t a typical hollywood ending in most cases a character gains something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three but willard both gains and loses he gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals and that is a shocking ending apocalypse now is francis ford coppola s tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking this film is wholly different from the godfather it is hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature at first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare this is not as much a film about the vietnam war as it is a film about the war within us at first it does appear to be another war film captain willard sheen is assigned by an army lieutenant a young harrison ford to assassinate a renegade american colonel named kurtz brando who is hiding out somewhere in vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves willard carries out his mission with extreme prejudice heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain chief albert hall chef frederic forest and a very young larry fishburne who later went on to appear as morpheus in the matrix apocalypse now is in a many ways a modern update of homer s odyssey as our main character willard carries on his journey he meets an array of original and strange characters including lt col kilgore robert duvall who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer dennis hopper whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser jeremy davies in the million dollar hotel one of the worst films i have ever seen davies failed to make any connection with an audience hopper does he is like the poetic vibe between willard and kurtz he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages in this case he is translating kurtz to willard although i m not so sure kurtz needs a translation of willard many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines apocalypse now has many kilgore descending upon a vietnam village playing wagner s ride of the valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history there is sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness when kilgore kneels down on that beach and says i love the smell of napalm in the morning it smells like victory we all crack a smile i won t lie to you apocalypse now is a strange film it isn t exactly the easiest thing to analyze the end may frustrate some viewers if they don t understand marlon brando s significant speeches but what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche the horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself kurtz says you have a right to kill me but you have no right to judge me brando s character kurtz is left to the audience to judge to many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head but that isn t what francis ford coppola is trying to get across by fighting in vietnam kurtz has realized just how great he had it and how bad some others had it by walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones living our lives in a fool s paradise we are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit by seeing how unlucky some vietnamese are kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something just how easily he could end up like the people around him and he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door many people think the horror is one thing it is two for kurtz the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the war s impact upon men and after willard murders kurtz and hears kurtz s dying words he realizes it too he realizes the effects of war to see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man and what it has done to him the horror 5 5 stars ,1
the forest isn t just your everyday standard slasher backwoods cannibal fare it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well the story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip a cave dwelling cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them there is something you don t see every slasher director don jones gets an a for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman michael brody aka gary kent the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest they realize too late that someone is stalking them they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife s lover the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn t work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting 4 10,0

people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films to be fair those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well done animated films such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischer you may be thinking to yourself well if it s so great why haven t i heard of it fair question this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity things are looking up though because it has finally been released on dvd under the title bugville it s funny that the film went through all this because it kind of mirrors the actual plot although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message ugh i personally think that the movie s main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times after all the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time our grasshopper hero hoppity desperately wants to help his endangered community problem each time he tries whether through the ill will of others or through simple bad luck he fails miserably and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he s trying to save although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook he occasionally breaks down and it s only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done no one is really self sufficient okay you re saying it has a good message two actually does that really make it exceptionally well done my answer partially it s not just the message that makes this movie special it s the characterization this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation you almost don t even need the spoken lines a good way to sum it all up is energetic or lively a lot of movies have used the selling point lovable cast of characters whenever i hear that line it always makes me think of this movie case in point the bad guys swat the fly and smack the mosquito many movies have lovable villains but i don t think you ll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly but sadly not larry that you ll ever find virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome yeah they re rotten no goodniks but you still care about them that s the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer director and crew the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes native americans and chinese i don t think they were intended to be malicious but they re there regardless they didn t bother me but it d be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them so if you share my weakness and i think you do give this one a go ,1
while i do not think this was a perfect 10 i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it s rated here no brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it s plot has been done many times before that doesn t mean it shouldn t be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments the acting of claire danes as already mentioned many times was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances pullman s wife the crooked cop skip or trip or whatever his name is the cinematography was also beautifully filmed there was a lot that s good to this movie even if there were some negatives three major ones that i found as well here is what i didn t like about it the friendship between the girls in fact the girls own individual personalities were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then because despite the positives more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film that however is not my major problem and warning spoiler alert the ending as mentioned dozens of times already was awful it was awful in two respects firstly even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood i wanted a happy ending yes it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or barring that at least the cop should have got what was coming to him i mean nothing happens to the bad guys they all get away with it very disturbing also i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending i understand endings that are inspired to make one think but this was not a mystery or clue type movie we were watching and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened who was guilty etc with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel i did not want to be kept guessing still there was a lot to like about this movie and the acting is definitely at the top of the list i would rate this a 7 5 and say it is definitely worth a look ,1
this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series bewitched this lovely sweet rom com is a timeless treasure the comparisons are obvious jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid straight kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket her feline familiar is being cared for by her beloved aunt you ll recognize the aunt from murder by death this movie is fun and touchingly sweet bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel worth a look ,1
the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it s just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it s still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn t work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children s film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn t the first time in the series it s also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only 3 10,0
i just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely hillarious some of the scenes i just couldn t stop laughing at dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes and just says the stoopidest things but at the same time he s just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway the beach scenery is very tranquil until along comes robbie coltrane not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you haven t got much else to do like i did you might need to hunt around for it though i was lucky as my local video store stocks it ,1
i ticked the contains spoiler box in case i say anything that is a spoiler and don t realise i ve said it until i re read it after i ve posted so it s just in case anyhow back to reviewing this film i saw this film on skymovies earlier on this afternoon and by the description sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when i actually got about 30 minutes into it i was appalled this film in my opinion has the worst scriptwriting and actors actresses ever the young girl who falls in love with the boy from l a after about 3 hours is a really stupid lame character who has an annoying whiney voice and boff hair then there s her lover who s an idiot and is also very whiney actually maybe they suit each other then there s the boy s mum who s with him on holiday and surprise surprise she s a doctor and oh my god wait there s even more unsuspected surprises a virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about viruses o shock horror yeah right lol then there s this insane religious lad who keeps going on about erbs or something and how the lord knows all everyone on the island seems to love him yet he s actually a stubborn arrogant steroid pumped you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim his head is like tiny and his body is massive it s hilarious buffoon who s had way too much to drink anyhow after all these weirdo characters including a stoned looking taxi driver the religious lad finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood sample and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that because for some reason he s dramatically been saved all down to erbs and god and oh my god yes there s another surprise you ll never guess what just in the nick of time with 11 minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead in fact including her son and his girl she finds the cure and injects everybody and it s all resolved what a pathetic film i mean i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it but i actually though it d be good and have some sub plot twists somewhere but no no it was just boring and dry don t watch this film you ll end up like me stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back ,0
as most other reviewers seem to agree this adaptation of after the funeral is very good indeed always one of my favourite poirot stories i was worried that it might be messed about with well it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining david suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as poirot and as others have pointed out the other star of this show is monica dolan who surely could not be bettered as miss gilchrist i also really enjoyed fiona glasscott who was spot on as the cutting rosamund shane but really the casting was quite impeccable throughout one point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn t mind how they tightened up the structure of the abernethie family in the book the family tree is really quite complicated the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end when they all leave enderby quite touching this is really one of the very best of the poirot series so far ,1
this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging also obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenager s family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenager s friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenager s house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash ,0
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it s terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it s so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create ,0
i have seen this movie twice now on cable the first time i saw it it caught me by suprise the skaters i was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of skateboarder magazine back in the late 70 s these were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating i am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be i am almost 40 years old now and i guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life s problems however this film did a great job of taking me back back to the vacant pools the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to cherry hill nj i suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it you had to live it otherwise it probably won t have the impact on you as it did me but for those of you and you know who you are who did live it you know exactly what i am talking about in any event i don t care who you are if you get a chance to see this movie do it i give thanks to the z boys of dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to stacy for making this movie job well done ,1
this solid little horror film is actually one of renny harlin s best the story is pretty routine stuff but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive in fact the ghost story is almost an afterthought the real horror comes from the prison setting itself and renny h spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling leaking rat infested old hellhole with a sadistic warden too viggo mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role supported by some very authentic looking prisoners there are no pretty boys in this cast horror fans should check this one out ,0
when i first saw this show i was 9 and it caught my attention right away when stewie was trying to call lois on the phone in the hotel i laughed and kept on watching when the episode was finished i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly this separates itself from the simpsons and other shows on say cartoon network because the jokes are more mature not too much but it s tv 14 for a reason the quick film cuts after each punch line and cute funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special talented seth macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show a good theme song and a crazy family that there s always something funny makes this my favorite cartoon along sealab 2021 and aqua teen hunger force check it out it s funny stuff ,1
thomas capano was not anne marie s boss tom carper the governor was that is the reason the feds became involved he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day i also read ann rule s book and saw the city confidential segment on a e tom capano was a megalomanic sp an uber controller and a monster he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control when she wouldn t let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control i think it s a waste of money that he is still alive ,1
i m not a big musical fan but this is one of the few i really love unlike many other musicals such as the sound of music none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff each song is social commentary acumen on war sexuality recalcitrance spirituality and freedom especially amazing songs are easy to be hard age of aquarius hair flesh failures 3 5 0 0 walking in space and hare krishna totally revolutionary and wonderful i can t wait to someday see it live ,1
i saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends its reputation had preceded it and though all my friends were also of legal age i alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it we gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend though we sat in close proximity to each other we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other s presence as it turned out the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt it did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content but it disappointed in every other way caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick it fails miserably in its ambition subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds the film s obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real graphic sex but in setting this sex in the context of caligula s depraved reign it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of caligula in it sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination in the present day it is somewhat common to hear words like sin and depravity used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it the historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex they fail to entertain enlighten intrigue or interest the viewer in any way they only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium rarely has a film proved so boring the sex after the initial shock and astonishment fades only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence while many films more violent than caligula have been made few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence apparenly unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper depraved sexuality characterized caligula s emperorship the violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex a review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells i understand why someone would want to see this film after all i myself succumbed to the same curiosity i simply hope that my review by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not my high school criminal justice teacher described police work as hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror this statement perfectly describes caligula you have been warned ,0
in her first nonaquatic role esther williams plays a school teacher who s the victim of sexual assault she gives a fine performance proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool as the detective out to solve the case george nader gives perhaps his finest performance and he is so handsome it hurts john saxon is the student under suspicion and although he gets impressive billing in the credits it s edward andrews as his overly protective father who is the standout bathed in glorious technicolor the unguarded moment is irresistible hokum and at times compelling drama ,1
the first few minutes of the bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with crawling text from the bible the part that samuel jackson recites to his soon to be victims in pulp fiction continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better sonny chiba or bruce lee and then chiba appears playing himself he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand unfortunately any entertainment value intentional or unintentional soon gets crushed by the disjointed story the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action to keep it simple here s why the bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch 1 you don t know what s going on 2 there are barely any fights 3 the fights that are there are short and terribly filmed sonny chiba is cool judy lee is gorgeous her face is glorious it s only for them that i give the bodyguard a 2nd star out of 10 this movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours ,0
shocking in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive he was sincere unpretentious and kindly he was at ease and looked like well educated and intellectual person in this movie i saw a clown the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry they made a cartoon the real gagarin was someone else don t believe in this movie i saw this movie after the movies like taming of fire and apollo 13 and after reading books rockets and people by chertok and korolev myths and facts by golovanov i was shocked by tiresome scenario poor acting and producing and a lots of inexactitudes of space race the movie is the tedious rendering of well known in russia historical facts a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated some facts and details were perverted for example in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner liberated in 1944 and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine but in special prison design bureau korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform imho the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can t to make interesting movies ,0
let s see there s a civil war a lost city a talking gorilla some regular gorillas a previously unknown species of killer albino gorilla the most powerful laser ever known to man a lot of diamonds lying mined and loose in the sand attack hippos an active volcano and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a downed plane that s not too much is it i ve had more coherent fever dreams and then the romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds because this was a lost city that he had been looking for or something but then the mean gorillas that we had seen before came out of nowhere and ate him now somehow the talking gorilla was back from visiting the regular gorillas and as a kind of earthquake or volcano started the woman industrialist doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead fiance s hand it s a blast if you re looking for more ammunition against the pernicious influence of michael crichton in american entertainment and hence world entertainment and if you keep firmly in mind the extent to which this cynical and half hearted attempt fell on its face at the boxoffice but sadly the men responsible crichton sceenwriter john patrick shanley director frank marshall probably never lost a dime shame on them and i mean that 1 10,0
it has been some years since i saw this but remember it and would like to see it again it kind of became a therapy for me with a personal experience of my own a thirty five year old man laments over a high school baseball game in which he missed the ball and his team lost he thinks about it 20 years later if only i d hit that ball and how his life would be better because of it then he gets a chance to find out and gets a little more than he bargained for it reminds me so much of when i was in high school i twice tried out for our drill dance team and didn t make it this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school if you were on it you were all that i didn t try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time i took it really hard i d hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise and that caused me to not make it that was in 1987 through the years even now sometimes i think if only i hadn t hit my leg i would ve never worn those stupid tights now i don t sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past who knows it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn t have met my son s father i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change be careful what you wish for ,1
i wouldn t call we re back a dinosaur s story simply a kiddie version of jurassic park i found it more interesting than that like the former it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman rhea perlman jay leno walter cronkite julia child kenneth mars yeardley smith martin short and larry king to paraphrase that a given actor the cheers woman the tonight show host the most trusted name in news a famous chef the young frankenstein police chief lisa simpson one of the three amigos and the cnn guy but i guess that i shouldn t focus only on the cast i thought that this movie had something for both children purely fun and adults natural history true it s escapism but the perceptive kind i would actually say that john goodman doing rex s voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in monsters inc worth seeing ,1
this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good even though some of the actors and actresses weren t very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old it was funny gross and just all out a very good movie in most parts i just didn t know what was going to happen next i was like i think this is going to happen wait i think this is going to happen all age groups will love this movie in some parts i couldn t stop laughing it was so funny but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldn t believe what i was seeing i am definitely going to see this movie again it is one of those movies where it can t get boring every time you see it is so suspenseful i definitely recommend seeing this movie ,1
one of the better made for tv biopics i just wish it had told us more i have read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters and this movie did what it could based on the constraints placed on it by the family cynthis gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring karen to life one of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into karen s anorexia in the reading i have done about the disease especially cherry boone o neill s wonderful book starving for attention anorexia appears to be a disease of control karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control she felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life don t get me wrong i believed she truly loved the music but she felt she had little control over her career she truly loved her family but they did not express it well and she didn t know how to make her family understand her the film could have touched so much more on that i treasure the music i have of the carpenters and wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today ,1
except for the glossy look this show had little to recommend it the writing was patronizing and convoluted without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic the female characters came off the worst reduced to spoiled selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos and try to bag a man this aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women the acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note this is not entirely the actors fault had they spent more time developing the characters and the storyline adding a little injection of style and humour mvp might have been a hit what we re left with is something flat and vaguely unpleasant ,0
this is a comedy based on national stereotypes no doubt if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions you can have fun with this film nicole kidman is at her best sexy moving and funny ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out shadowed by nicole and the rest of the cast does good work as well the final is moving and logical movie logics of course worth watching if you accept the rules of the game ,1
how disney can you get preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson is disney trying to send a lesson to itself that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human whatever the psycho analysis this movie sucked the girls want a rich party for their rich lives but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant yes milk going to employ the workers they keep it afloat until daddy comes home and the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one but the ending is dumb webcam in the cayman islands huh not worth my time ever again but it is better than howl s moving castle d ,0
when i first watched this film i thought that it would be rally good because it featured my favourite actor of all time he gives a sterling performance though it is fairly obvious he didn t have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work he is the only good thing in it unlesss you re into explosions and american dream working class hero trash which i m not i don t get it how can this film get away with being so naf that bit with the little boy being rescued i mean come on you can t tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire guy wearing any goggles i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can t see for more than a couple of feet infront of you and no breathing equipment he d have choked after 2 minutes this film was just bad ok why robert whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy sorry if this is your favourite film ,0
this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of jesus christ the high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience this film is not for everyone i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation god and humanity whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open to discussion ,1
the title says it all i m not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie obviously this movie didn t have a multi million dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd i ll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films dylan o leary cast and crew i thank you ,1
while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics both are way above average roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type a tough courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering he played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws not nearly as gritty but the same get the job done despite the politicians and gutsy approach if a man who can t swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark isn t gutsy then tell me what is tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain most of the villains in fact have some depth and complexity this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings overall it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city gritty unglamorous often dangerous but filled with energy the story is spare tight and subtle it gets the job done without extraneous elements it may not be one of the all time greats but it is an exceptionally good movie everyone has an opinion about car chases mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt the pontiac ventura chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block v8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6 the ventura novas got little respect off the drag strip but with the proper suspension mods they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track the bawling of those gm v8 s as they wind up is music to the enthusiast s ear i ve heard this chase criticized for imitating the bullitt chase the truth is that they are two works by the same master bill hickman who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase besides driving most of the car chase scenes he created a brooding malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers yes the chase has realism errors often noted like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades parkway the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm that s beside the point let s face it movie car chases are unreal by nature in bullitt the french connection and the seven ups however bill hickman and phillip d antoni crafted chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying rolling exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films ,1
how living the dream managed to get into the laemmle 5 in west hollywood is beyond me as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i should have known when the first scene opened in gasp eugene oregon that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school but can t as they are such losers is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad then cliché the three high school losers end up in la and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting but no one works as a used car salesman the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent and they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an executive recruitment firm with no experience just showing the supposed good life in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad they better not have sag cards i could go on and on about this bad film but i ended up walking out of the theater which had at the start six people and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience i wanted to like this film but i couldn t find one merit in the story characters writing dialog nor the actors whoever cast this film should retire amen enough ,0
the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story it s something i would have done my 1st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didn t really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorter which would have been a blessing not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week i d have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one ,0
despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky or think he s a tired relic from the 1960s i really had no opinion of the man save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist although i could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings so stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky rebel without a pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 11 i decided to get it just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him while glad i got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so what s all the fuss about for a man with so many degrees lauded as the most important intellectual alive by the new york times according to the dvd s case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and i wouldn t even want to watch what a william f buckley could do to him granted the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he d say rather than being on linguistics so maybe that s the reason he came off so badly but again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film this much i knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the soviet empire the film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it s difficult to separate all of the jumble his wife carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film she seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 11 was a great thing for the chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background it s assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that and slack jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him this is really poor film making by director and editor will pascoe who in the dvd s filmmaker statement shows he s yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky s other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky s lectures at mcmaster university in ontario canada prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003 much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era yes he makes some good points here and there on american media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals as example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled similarly he claims trilateralists run the world and that people s fear of crime is yet another cabal s result of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when castro and company were great sponsors of it in latin america asia and africa until the soviet union fell i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species mixing impregnation centers up in idaho in his simpleminded world without grays chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals in short chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually near this film s end he warns be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn t like no matter how barbarous their crimes and anti intellectual their posit please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant dvd ,0
i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago being made almost 30 years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame boy was i wrong there are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine even the acting was great jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald pleasance was superb on the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it it makes all the copycats e g nightmare on elm street scream look very tame i can t really say it is carpenter s best because i have not seen many of his the only one i can remember of his is starman i think he made it halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre ,1
i have to admit when i went to see this movie i didn t really have high expectations but even with my low expectations i was totally and utterly disappointed basically luke wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends there s slight mention of a girl stalking him but that s pretty much it for that character which i don t quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie so while on a subway rainn wilson who i actually liked before this movie convinces him to talk to a hot girl uma thurman this is strange to say the least as everyone can clearly see that uma thurman does not belong under the category of hot rainn wilson s performance is also far from hot normally i m all for his acting but even he couldn t salvage this movie his character was jumpy unrealistic and rather annoying you could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate it was almost painful but anyway someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway and luke wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber now we all know that uma thurman is the superhero or g girl as they like to call her in the movie it still baffles me as to what the g stands for but we ll leave that for the message boards to debate the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny but i find myself asking who has sex like that they nearly throw the bed through the wall because of uma thurman s passion let s say it makes my head hurt but not in the i m thinking really hard to understand this way when uma insults anna faris calling her a whore i had no debate with that apart from the fact that she can t choose movies properly she can t act and relies souly on the fact that she s blonde and typical overall i would ve walked out of the theater if i hadn t paid 8 75 to see it the characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially uma thurman someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn t mean you re acting also the script and storyline could ve used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid i actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers overall if you value your money and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie ,0
one of the last classics of the french new wave for direction cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early century cinema for story eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life so many things can be said of this film observationally brilliant self indulgently overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally draining etc etc in my mind whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths every film student writer or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts no music video overstyling no soap opera like plot twists and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie everything is to be admired the writing concise clever surprisingly funny acting everyone quite simply is perfect in their respective roles and simple direction the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film make this film unforgettable this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you ,1
travolta thurman the rock vaughn keitel and so on one should think that this star parade of great actors could really heat up this movie but no travolta takes on the role as chili palmer again but this time we have already seen the gangster who tries hes luck in the hard world of movie making its not funny anymore this is a typically problem in hollywood they think that if the first was good the second will be twice as good no the first was original the second cant be hey hollywood try to understand originality cant be duplicated you got to give us a new twist not just the same movie again made with a bigger budget i constantly found my selves hardly laughing when i was watching this movie but still it got a lot of cool actors like harvey keitel james woods vince vaughn and the rock and for that and that only 4 10,0
a young couple father ben solid charles bateman wife nicky the lovely ahna capri and their daughter kt the cute geri reischl of i dismember mama fame find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical lunatics worse yet there s a pernicious satanic cult that s been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes director bernard mceveety working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l q jones devil times five director sean macgregor came up with the bizarre story relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy edgy mysterious ooga booga atmosphere strother martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as doc duncan who s the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect the top rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset jones as gruff no nonsense sheriff hillsboro alvy moore as friendly local toby and charles robinson as a shrewd fiercely devout priest jack john arthur morrill s bright polished widescreen cinematography jamie mendoza nava s spooky score and the wild rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting nice eerily ambiguous ending too a pleasingly idiosyncratic and under appreciated winner ,1
i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the end the first 3 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry ade but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laugh out loud moments make you realize how less than brilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous the end of the movie the green scenes for those of you who ve seen it was perhaps the worst ending i ve seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didn t bother me and wasn t funny which did to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the fondest memories that i can but i have to warn you if you re about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer don t there are far better things to spend your money on ,0
i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts pickup artists themselves comment on them choosing the winner their jokes are amusing and some participators are really fun to watch more so this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women lots of expert s comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men who like women ps pardon for my broken engrish ,1
fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace and far more entertaining if you ask me hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days i hate to describe it too much it s so short that the premise is just about the whole thing suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots the princess anne droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair and fluke starbucker is even more of a dork than his original if that s possible ernie fosselius is one crazy son of a buck he s also the source of porklips now the apocalypse now spoof ,1
it s some years since i ve seen this movie so forget most of the details however i loved it at the time and found the plot intensely gripping the climax heart stopping i remember being literally on the edge of my seat at the theatre back in 1979 jane fonda plays a los angeles reporter kimberley who stumbles upon an accident at a local nuclear power facility she wants to go public with the story aided by her hippie cameraman michael douglas who has photographed the event but a sinister conspiracy attempts to cover it all up jack lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the nuclear plant s conflicted middle manager torn between loyalty to his company and doing the right thing by reporting the perilous situation his facial expressions speak volumes here apart from the engrossing plot and riveting tension this film is all about jack lemmon his character and his superb acting performance as for jane fonda i was a huge fan of hers at the time i suspect she just moved on from her anti war protests to taking on the nuclear industry this movie seems intended as a nuclear scare tactic chernobyl and three mile island notwithstanding they re different types of reactors our canadian candu reactor is safe and well respected around the world i wouldn t hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant about an hour s drive away where my friend works as a very competent engineer apparently they shut down for every teeny problem irregardless of the financial loss i sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies afoot there one can hardly imagine any of the managers or highly trained operators willing to risk any sort of meltdown or whatever it s absolute tomfoolery of course the moral here is to spare no expense or effort either in building the facility or ensuring its ongoing safety if we want our western lifestyle we have to get our energy somewhere for those who claim nuclear power can never be made completely safe true of course perhaps they should volunteer as a coal miner or else return to pre electricity horse and buggy days by all means enjoy this entertaining and highly suspenseful movie which apparently is based loosely embellished on a true story it s a real chiller a thriller and maybe even a killer but please don t get your attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it ,1
from rainy dreary late winter england of early 1920s where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens dreams known now as world war i four women share this lovely small sunny italian castle on a hill one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying two women who will rediscover their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends these four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier almost blind to get a spiritual makeover for one great april vacation in early 1920 s italy note to would be filmmakers study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story probably not a film to please many men note stock up on coffee hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day spring is coming enchanted april promises you ,1
i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i ve seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90 s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here this is the perfect blend of 80 s and 90 s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90 s films and the stalking slasher madness of an 80 s flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right direction denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie ,1
there are films that are not released in theaters but on video this one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does no story inept violence over acted badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film and i did like and enjoyed some of siegel s other movies ,0
a vastly underrated black comedy the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow baby jane reynolds and winters are mothers of young convicted murderers a nod to compulsion who run away to hide in hollywood they run a school for would be movie tots a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms debbie in her blonde wig i m a harlow you re more a marion davies she tells winters leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad weaver she also does a deliciously funny tango and over all gives an outstanding performance unlike anything she d done before the atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie it looks wonderful with great period detail 30 s lots of lovely swipes at hollywood and the terrifying movie tot micheal macliammoir has a ball as the drama coach hamilton starr he purrs two r s but prophetic nonetheless see it and love it ,1
i may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity i turned the channel the original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for adam west and burt ward put these two actors in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad ,0
so so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book pitt s a serial killer on the lam unbeknownst to dave and juliette is his poor not all there companion this is a good cast and the story moves along but pitt isn t belivably scary as a serial killer although it is one of his better earlier roles the best thing is here is michelle forbes who always manages to shine whether in her roles on homicide life on the street or in the brief series wonderland vote 6,1
i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them these days though people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness it has a slow beginning but then look out if you love romantic comedies but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change or at least did have back in the 70 s then you should see this movie ,1
years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2 i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii wrong i wish i d stopped at ii the storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter pacino s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2 then scenes such as corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goodies get away and everyone else is shot daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isn t ready for an emergency no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again but i ll watch 1 2 many times down the years ,0
warning small plot details revealed i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film it is written so badly that every character is a caricature yet it seems to take itself seriously it is poorly cast especially ralph macchio all baby faced 5 foot nothing of him as a streetwise tough plot elements are all drawn in black and white with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax most egregious of all plot element about to be revealed it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi serious film one can just imagine the filmmakers saying we need jobeth to shed her top hmmm i ve got it early in the film let s give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways then jobeth can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the hallway yeah that s the ticket i will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984 one that proved all too weighty in the late 90 s with events like columbine however the execution is dreadful this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of heathers a campy political statement like network or a serious examination like brubaker instead it tries to be all of these things and ends up being none of these things teachers get an f ,0
great chris diamantopoulos has got to be the best robim williams that i have every seen he acts it up perfectly this was like watching robim williams as he really was and is it almost made me cry watching him i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it s own merits very sad what both of them went through i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times i am glad that they ended it in a high note i hope robin puts a 100 bill in this guy s hat and it was great that it was filmed in vancouver ,1
i love this show it s clever and very well acted david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief after every new episode i m always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is my only complaint would be donna murphy s absence at this point in the second season as david morse ex wife heather she added such character to the show i think this show is a credit to the crime drama genre with that said i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique ,1
as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasn t been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema read blair witch project i wasn t disappointed mystery men was definitely not a high effects tension filled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and garofolo are hilarious together as always and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness william h macy plays a great straight man while kel mitchell and the fart powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy though the sets are bizarre and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off guard and bring tears from the belly laughers among us i definitely recommend this movie although not an all time classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread the writing is good and the cast is great if you re worried plan on the matinee and pay less but either way you ll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesn t root for the losers once in a while ,1
i wrote an essay in 1981 the year i graduated high school called the last american virgin i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film apparently her daughter got a hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house a year later i wake up one morning and see the advertisement for this film i was 18 years old based the essay on experiences in my life the film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it i did not have any proof of this matter except my english teacher mr versace who gave me an a on my essay i let it go never did anything about it i figured what comes around goes around i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film i just needed to get it off my chest as i really never told anyone about it except my closest friend they agreed to keep it a secret the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at i guess thats what hollywood is all about getting stories from wherever you can it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though ghost writer ,0
 warning spoilers ahead the writers of this story knew these men very well the actors likewise portrayed them very well the result is that by the end of the film you feel like you re actually watching john lennon and paul mccartney the expected tensions are there especially in the awkward first moments but as the two begin to loosen up the old camaraderie that made the beatles work so well begins to show through the bitterness is still there and interrupts at times but by the time john gets the idea to take lorne michaels up on his offer to pay the beatles the gag sum of 3000 to appear on saturday night live the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized liverpool together as teens and survived playing the rough nightclubs of hamburg to rise to superstardom but in the end this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently we are reminded why a beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before lennon s assassination the two driving forces of the group outgrew each other ,1
robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four dimensional atomic age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci fi in its time with psychological overtones yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive it s a camp fest tailor made for tv s late late show wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one dimensional though patty duke playing a cute brat pre miracle worker gets a colorful memorable exit from ,0
one of the worst shows of all time the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad ass girl who are these actors never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show the stories were as unbelievable as the actors lame would be the best way to describe it somehow this show makes a slug like ice t more believable as a cop and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded ,0
ok so maybe it s because i m from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film but i found this great fun cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all i was actually quite effected when they died in particulare when the captain finally fell the script well it s a game of 2 halfs the opening half of the film is well written and sharp the last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me but nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from sturton ,1
i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance i really hope norton did not do this he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie i found it entertaining it wasn t mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects but it was not a bad it was fun to watch but yea definitely not a bad horrible movie 7 10,1
why can t there be better tv movies made i was at a loose end today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the uk what a terrible waste of my time it was poor sets poor acting oh my god what a terrible flood blimey that woman can even outrun a torrent of water too i really wish that people would make tv movies using better effects better or at least more believable plots far better acting killer flood is well up there with poor acting a few bits of ham couldn t act any worse 1 final thing i really agree with the comment about the dog but i believe it would of already scarpered in real life ,0
the movie opens with charlie jeff daniels a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli it appears he doesn t have enough cash to cover the check instead of reaching for his plastic he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying unbeknownst to charlie lulu melanie griffith had been observing him from the other side of the deli lulu is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980 s with a brunette page boy cut she follows him out to let him know that she saw what he did he tries to deny it but can t escape her accusation thinking he s in it charlie is surprised when lulu says she doesn t work for the deli and then offers him a ride back to work when she heads in the opposite direction thus begins their cavorting across the middle atlantic seaboard we re supposed to get titillated as thoroughly modern lulu puts straight laced charlie into humiliating situations it s all right when the two consenting adults get a little kinky in a motel room but off putting when they wriggle out of paying the check at a family style restaurant stealing the labor from hard working people is not my idea of wild charlie is a jerk lulu is a loony jerk she starts to pass off charlie as her husband first to her mom who blithely tolerates the charade and then at her conveniently timed 10 year high school reunion an event used later by another too cool for its own good movie grosse pointe blank the marriage comes as a surprise to lulu s real husband ray liotta who s just been recently released from prison for armed robbery ray gives the two a welcome comeuppance and shows them how nasty crime really is i can t add any irony by writing that i first watched this by sneaking in the movie theater no i don t do that sort of thing i taped it off of cable tv and assure you i view it strictly in the privacy of my own home so i got to thinking why i taped it when i don t like it very much and conclude that 20 years ago i was on a reggae kick and the soundtrack of something wild does prominently feature reggae the closing credits start with the treat of sister carol performing her version of wild thing ,0
i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this leans towards the gothic feel i would love to see this as a full feature film carrie,1
chris penn is hilarious as the all time stoner brother of jeff spicoli this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge this movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong fast times was more depressing than funny abortions friends cheating on friends jerking off in bathrooms bad jobs and failing school someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle schocked in the liquor store or ben stein in his first role in the sunny s surplus store ,1
the film made no sense to me whatsoever good actors sergiocastellittoaparticular favourite he was great in uomo dellestelle thestarmaker but that was made by giuseppe tornatore a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort but awful rambling script terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing apretentious load of rubbish but the sort of film that certain italianpseudo intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece i never thought much of bellochio as director i remember seeing his first film pugninella tasca fists in the pocket or some such title in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago i was living thereat the time all the usual pseudos raved about it but it left me pretty cold i didn t think he was much of a director then and still don t age has certainly not improved him and this film must rank as one of his worst ,0
this was a crappy movie with a whole lotta non sense and too many loose ends to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron livingston made a cameo in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get and each time it got more ridiculous sean crawley good looking chris l mckenna whom i ve never seen before but loved his little nude scene is making ends meet as a painter when he meets electrician duke wayne george wendt from cheers thinking he s getting more work from duke sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews daniel baldwin playing a stereotypically evil guy ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant ron livingston in a cameo who i ve been in love with from office space up to sex the city ray end up offering the apparently desperate for cash sean 13k to kill the accountant and sean accepts the job sean stalks out the accountant whose wife kari wuhrer he finds himself attracted to completes the hit and leaves taking the file of information against ray with him sean quickly learns he was being used that ray never intended to pay him and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money up to this point it s a descent flick generally worth watching but as soon as ray duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him it just got dumber and dumber and still dumber until finally it seemed like the film s writer charlie higson had snapped out of a 10 day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something without simply detailing the movie let s just say that in every single scene you watch after the kidnapping you find yourself gasping what the f k baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption in the end so many loose ends are left in the movie that you begin to regret that you even watched it this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it s full value it s supposed to be a psychological thriller and mckenna is a decent actor but it s hard to give yourself to the movie when you have norm from cheers and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense guys will love the violence blood and guts scenes and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots girls will enjoy handsome sean s gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie personally i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ron livingston is only in the first one third of the movie ,0
made after quartet was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham here the three stories are the verger mr know it all and sanitorium the first two are comic the verger is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories james hayter soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick is the hero in the verger he holds this small custodial type job in a church but the new vicar michael hordern is an intellectual snob when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop he has a good eye and his store thrives soon he has a whole chain of stores when his grandchild is christened by hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments i ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting according to maugham he met a man like max kelada nigel patrick on a cruise in mr know it all kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white who is somewhat silently disapproving of max max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ship s entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas 1935 as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i won t describe the way max rises to the occasion sanitorium is the longest segment roland culver plays ashenden the fictional alter ego of maugham a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock s the secret agent here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman finlay currie as an irascible scotsman john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is at war with currie raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and rennie is ironic but deeply moving it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet and well worth watching ,1
now i don t hate cheap movies i just don t see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad s camcorder if i rent a movie i want it to be a movie not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv tapes maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it wasn t maybe i hate it because it s cheap has the dumbest plot ever the most unrealistic characters ever and the really really really worst showdown in the history of films ever even tom savini can t save this seriously this one is a complete waste of time ,0
pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses rachel leigh cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance but i would recommend this film only to die hard fans of the actress ,0
of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn t have anything to it if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time it is bad they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i don t think it is possible ,0
this is one of the best animated movies i ve ever seen in my life this isn t just a fun movie or a well made movie this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren t just the technical skill that went into making it would grant it a place in the history of animation wladyslaw starewicz created a stop motion movie about the secret life of beetles he imagined a coherent world of insects with jobs houses nightclubs movie houses even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge mr beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly much to the chagrin of a grasshopper but he s a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling mr beetle returns home and finds mrs beetle having her own affair mr beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife the two make up and go out to the movies and the movie they watch is mr beetle and the dragonfly described thus it sounds banal but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema along with emile cohl and jiri trnka wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work for that reason he must not remain forgotten ,1
i broke my own rule buying this movie from the 5 88 bin at walmart basically if a movie has a big star in it and you ve never heard of it before it s usually for a reason well in the case of this movie the reason is because it sucked they plaster sandra bullock s photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait and it reeled this little fishie right on in i was thinking of donating the disc to charity or giving it to the library but i don t think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie worst lines what do you mean army buddies what do you mean your dad ,0
i caught this on ifc last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film heavy on style little on substance and originality does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and blond to boot boy with 70s shag hair and too cool for school clothes plus this film wallows in late 1970s chic which works for some sofia coppola s the virgin suicides comes to mind but not for this director another reviewer compared this to harmony korine s work and i agree yet i don t view this as a positive thing what has he done lately anyway bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved if you happen to see it late night on cable turn the channel and watch something else instead ,0
i was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn t instead it was something that shouldn t have been made not even for its time they disguise themselves in the blackface fashion because they fly to africa and they even act like stepin fetchit and all the others rolled into one there are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics being a mixed woman i have the right to say this but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try merrie melodies coal black and de sebben dwarfs or angel puss you won t find them on dvd because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream but you can find them on a site as youtube i don t recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early america was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation i know it was 1932 but i have seen better for its time plane unnecessary 1 out of 10 ,0
the great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970 this twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the golden era of the genre there were musicals prior to that and there have been musicals since but the true classics seem invariably to have been made during that period singin in the rain an american in paris the band wagon seven brides for seven brothers oklahoma south pacific the king and i and many more stand tall as much cherished products of the age perhaps the last great musical of the golden era is carol reed s 1968 oliver freely adapted from dickens novel this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production it is a magnificent film winner of six oscars including the best picture award orphan oliver twist mark lester lives a miserable existence in a workhouse his mother having died moments after giving birth to him following an incident one meal time he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour but oliver doesn t settle particularly well into his new job and escapes after a few troubled days he makes the long journey to london where he hopes to seek his fortune oliver is taken under the wing of a child pickpocket called the artful dodger jack wild who in turn works for fagin ron moody an elderly crook in charge of a gang of child thieves despite the unlawful nature of the job oliver finds good friends among his new family he also makes the acquaintance of nancy shani wallis girlfriend of the cruellest and most feared thief of them all the menacing bill sikes oliver reed after many adventures oliver discovers his true ancestry and finds that he is actually from a rich and well to do background but his chances of being reunited with his real family are jeopardised when bill sikes forcibly exploits oliver making him an accomplice in some particularly risky and ambitious robberies oliver is a brilliantly assembled film consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast moody recreates his stage role with considerable verve stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as fagin lester and wild do well too as the young pickpockets while wallis enthusiastically fleshes out the nancy role and reed generates genuine despicableness as sikes the musical numbers are staged with incredible precision and sense of spectacle onna white s oscar winning choreography helps make the song and dance set pieces so memorable but the lively performers and the skillful direction of carol reed also play their part the unforgettable tunes include food glorious food consider yourself you ve got to pick a pocket or two i d do anything and oom pah pah all immensely catchy songs conveyed via very well put together sequences the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience and never really loses momentum over its entire 153 minute duration sit back and enjoy ,1
to start with i have done some further research on the film firslty jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film secondly this was a very low budget film created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir thirdly the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers the producers of rififi asked them to film their surprisingly i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject surprisingly for some not very obvious reason they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop it s impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings to add on to my praise i will say this some might say that this was a typical hollywood film on the contrary this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film laslty i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins and that side doesn t always have to be the good one for once i can say that a film is not predictable ten stars ,1
i m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i ve ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they re a couple the movies grabs you right away and doesn t let go you can t look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece ,1
i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse supposibly children s film i have ever seen in my life i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film they should pay you to watch it not you pay them it s truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards stephen,0
this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring byington performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner ,1
troma founder lloyd kaufman is the crapkeeper in this anthology film made up of two films that were such celluloid feces that llyod tried to salvage them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in copious amounts of nudity whenever possible does it work nope it s still crap that i d have to scrape off my boots if i stepped in it will anyone like this mess sure young teen aged mongoloids with the combined iqs of a vienna sausage have to laugh at something i guess for those who have brains that are even semi functioning steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence even dude where s my car would do my grade f,0
i don t usually like to see movies while they re still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious not like the usual blonde teenybopper bs so i decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it s opening night i must tell you i was happily surprised i went to this film with no expectations i didn t really know what it would be about but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision alberta watson also did a fantastic job as the role of tamara s disease stricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of megan park as tamara s friend brenda the film was wonderfully directed by gail harvey and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50 s way that leaves you feeling warm and happy even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting i also thought that the film was well shot many beautiful images of a 1950 s countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come this film as a whole was quirky and great i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open ended way i was still left satisfied whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful coming of age story or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950 s i guarantee this film is for you even if you have no expectations it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed give this one a shot ,1
i saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on hbo and i loved it it was so hilarious i have seen it too many times to count i love the stork brothers and the pitiful ugly dog bosco my favorite quote form the movie is it s so ugly it should be put to sleep i also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls on the back and their faces stick that way i love john cusack and demi moore in this movie too they were great this movie brings back memories of my college days when i first saw it i rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over my college roommate and i just couldn t get enough of it who couldn t love this crazy movie i want to buy a copy on dvd does anyone know where i can get it ,1
the brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process which is a conventional but executed intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post wwii but in the fact that this story was told at all samuel goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands an alcoholic and an underachiever ,1
some of the reviewers of this film were extremely generous with praise i personally was disappointed because due to those reviews i was optimistic as the opening credits began to roll the all too familiar story line goes like this deformed boy and his father live out in louisiana swamp local boys ridicule and torment him local boys start gruesome s oh sorry i mean victor crowley s cabin on fire with him in it dad attempts to rescue his son formerly known as eddie munster meets the elephant man but accidentally puts a hatchet through the kid s head instead victor becomes a murderous ghost who hunts down unfortunates who enter his domain oooo scary one thing i appreciated about hatchet was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh the thing is i ve grown tired of the hollywood polished b horror slap sticks i like to laugh and i enjoy a good scare but this film didn t deliver a solid dose of either as for crowley being the next michael jason or freddy pumpkinhead has a better chance ,0
saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana that is not really criticizing it only making jokes about it grace trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in u k and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of debts the problem is that grace who imagined to have some money saved for her discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband s pounds in debts to not lose all of her things specially her house that she loves so much she never worked before and is in a tragic situation until matthew her gardener who is very found of smoking pot decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale ,1
this movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in english history the film version of cromwell s growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus protestant both sides were protestant cromwell was never present at the battle of edgehill nor did he ever save the day the royalists did not win the battle ended in a draw as another reviewer has noted cromwell was certainly not one of the five members who were to be removed from the house and arrested overall this movie was decent the producers tried way to hard and it didn t turn out so great definitely could have been better ,0
there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they re not careful you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended why the movie presents at the end nothing it solid it s not definite it s about what the individual viewer takes out of it i think that was the plan from the get go people aren t meant to all understand it in the same way it s almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little better the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is it s dramatic and thought provoking a lot of heavy ideas but the pace of the movie is almost soothing even with its more intense scenes with yelling i think it s probably leland he s just calm and almost serene even for all of his sadness the movie personifies leland in a way of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it but there are some recycled ideas i mean leland has a lot of impressive dialogue he is anything but typical but he s not a prophet everything he says is not a revelation many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned even i have observed a few things he s observed leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan gosling s portrayal in the end the acting is all exceptional there are no real bad guys there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland only to maybe understand him and life a little better comparable to igby goes down i think not comedic but similar in its general outlook on life ,1
i still liked it though warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero what saves this movie is the set the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action or plot but i got very little the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad the movie at some points just stood still you expected something more and you got nothing al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman and warren beatty in a film other than isthar i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things the thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool and visually the movie is amazing the sets are incredible the writing is only fair and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway spoileri especially thought the finale was not big enough it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway the costumes and makeup were flawless as well the facial makeup for the villains was great beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character still this is a good movie that could have been much much more it is to me better than batman the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross ,1
i ve seen about 820 movies released between 1931 39 and the informer is the worst major release i ve seen from that time span awful despicable unpleasant unhappy unredeemable saga of a complete loser watch a 1934 b western instead ,0
icarly is about a teenage girl named carly shay miranda cosgrove who lives with her artist brother spencer in a loft in seattle carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year so much money she doesn t even know its a real number her best friend is sam janette mccrudy who s as predictable as they come she says normal things and beats up carly s neighbor freddie who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn t have emotion sam chases freddie around and freddie screams in one episode carly and her friends shoot lewbert the doorman down in elevator and he survives i would not recommend this at all unless you like teenagers shouting hurting people and making fun of stuff ,0
like freddy s revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn t go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy i ve not alot to say about this it s moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series ,0
like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very short lasting about one minute so because of its brevity it s not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time it s actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the prints were hand painted making annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance i ve actually seen two different versions one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout i think the red one depicted on the dvd the great train robbery and other primary works is the best of them the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art and unlike other one minute or less films of the day this one is one i could see repeatedly it s just that visually compelling and odd if you want to see it online there is a 36 second version on google video type in serpentine dance ,1
as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it s underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i ve never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex sarved teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half gary s friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy but it s so much more than that it s a very honest movie it s also very 80ish which i love if you love the 80 s or grew up in the 80 s rent this movie but there may be some people that don t like the 80 s but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think it s very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it s an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin 1 2 out of ,1
my sincere advice to all don t watch the movie don t even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes it s 3 30 am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called survival i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish movie happy republic day to one and all :),0
i really liked zb1 really i did i have no problem with extremely low budget movies and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3 if you can imagine such a thing check out wiseguys vs zombies if you re interested indeed i prefer lower budget zombie films because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are about but zb3 was just so bad it was retarded i don t want to bother being dignified in my criticism i want my 90 minutes back etc except that it really only took 80 minutes because partway through i put it into 1 4x fast forward okay here s some criticism 1 the pacing was terrible everyone talked in monologues even when someone just had a single line the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1 s 70 minutes but there were actually fewer events in zb3 it s all talking 2 the gore effects got stupider just glop rubbed around on people s tummies 3 despite the epic exposition there really wasn t a plot and the exposition is indeed epic i won t spoil it if you re going to watch it don t watch it but then it s just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for 80 minutes or fewer if you so choose ,0
there is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school the parental absence at all important junctures in lauren ambrose s school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading the incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another thus masking her mother s truer involvement in family losses the daughter lauren really has done something big trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself somewhat heroic in light of the age she is still giving when everyone around her taking somersaults on her a heart not yet connected to her head something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day her replacement of a significant other not necessarily requiring a father image however a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real a pure cup without a handler see the movie everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time she has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress given a bird in a cage not a puppy that would a least get her walking two times a day ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life sad is the looming psychiatric ending how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life the symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story the neighbor college freshman is developed just fine he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning i myself eventually just went to the mensa magazine and got a 20 00 degree saying i was an hon ddiv it offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content run the world or do not get your own home was the college offer who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning the only sin is not having your pleasure right what fight figged on that she has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life what is college a reward for failing high school do you graduate with your class or without it what is the exchange a lifetime of correcting youth with only questions could lead occur w o a question the loss followed as much for good as bad when was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled why didn t good people treat her with good things if good people do not do good things for good people what is good for she is young pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game her act taken in life with a closed door perhaps the title would be better as christmas doors not admissions ,1
ali g was funny at first his interviews were fresh and original the idea of a mock gangster wearing ott clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first but this film is just a rehash of old jokes the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part the film claimed good actors like charles dance but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2 d characters it is not terrible but isn t really funny at all a second time it could be said that the movie was ali g s last bastion of comedy after that he ran out of steam ,0
not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted i will only say this nearly everybody says they loved curly best but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts i think it s the most hilarious from start to finish as well as being the most re watchable the off key singing student christine mcintire s cousin basil routine and of course emil sitka s j p are highlights but only around the stooges impeccable timing and the great writing too nuff said ,1
this is truly a funny movie his dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes i can recall i thought the i am gay scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic though it was funny while watching it for the third time i started to pick up on a little small segments that i had missed one was when matt dillon s girl friend a classic ditz tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before kevin klein made this film successful along tom selleck this was also the first time i could appreciate debbie reynolds she proved that she can be funny she confirmed this in the tv series will and grace one discovery that i found after the third viewing is lauren ambrose of 6 feet under fame she sticks out with her red bangs but it is obvious that this is one of her first films bob newhart is also very funny at the high school principle ,1
this is a good time to say how good i think of this site it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration i lived for two hours awaiting for something to happens for something to be said to be shown to be insinuated subtly for a symbol an idea whatever no just long endless violins alternated by a tired piano tired voices tired actors and bored characters and situations boring is the long death of the mind and this movie is from that point of view a public enemy how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators i don t claim for my money back just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing oh god ,0
this film was very interesting to me virtually a film within a film which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor who happen to dislike each other in producing sexual chemistry on film the director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film sex is comedy is much more than a comedy packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex i loved this film the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art ,1
there have been very few great comedy films in the history of hindi cinema andaz apna apna happens to be one of them the film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men aamir and salman who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire s daughter raveena aamir and salman khan try their best to outwit each other and woo raveena the plot thickens when paresh rawal co plan to take over all the wealth the movie is well paced and very funny rarely does one come across a hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent this is one of the few films with aamir and salman together probably the only film unfortunately it did not succeed at the box office and we might never see a film of this calibre again aamir khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film salman khan gives a very good performance as a dim wit raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl and karishma who is raveena s assistant friend is also funny paresh rawal junior ajith shakti kapoor deven verma jagdeep and tiku talsania just add to the flavour of the film all in all the best hindi comedy ever made and i wish they make more quality films like this one you will want to watch this film time and again p s for those of you who have watched this film i also suggest gol maal chupke chupke chhoti si baat naram garam hera pheri old and new etc ,1
i m not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain s novel the postman always rings twice i m not even sure if viscounti acquired the book s rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of cain s story i like the 1981 version best but thanks to visconti s excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i don t think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of cain s much praised book ,1
very violent and nicely filmed movie paulina is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too this movie has lots of black humor this guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster there will be sometimes when you wouldn t know whether to shiver or to smile and think am i laughing at someone who is killing people ,1
this movie is so bad it s good in an unintentionally funny way i couldn t stop watching it i was laughing so much it s like a parody of a romantic thriller except it s not a parody alexandra paul plays emily wendell an oppressed preacher s wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing sevier is guilty of though is bad acting mind you he s no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea they re in a really awful film they re playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then luke s final words to emily i was howling with laughter evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso that s probably the highlight of the film ,0
the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where cohen s intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry his irony his all round humanity laughter and tears in one to see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream i m a singer is a true pain it s the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennon s imagine nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original if there is a form of art that doesn t need embellishments it s cohen s art embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make up of sex for sale in this cohen s tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show it s cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around they may have been friends or his daughter s he could have become very tender hearted and in the mood for a gift too bad it didn t stay in the family fortunately but only at the very end cohen himself performed his majestic tower of song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2 all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home a sad show really and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do ,0
this film s basic premise is a political cartoon i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feel good film on gender equality indeed a recent commentator stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do what claptrap no one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately demi moore buffing up for seal hell week in the early 27 week bud s program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so there is approximately an 80 dropout rate in what is arguably the roughest military training program those are the ones who voluntarily drop out can t compete on a physical level suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can t handle the psychological harassment i never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived purported message of this film in the real world demi wouldn t last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training wishing alone won t do it skip this film as wishful thinking and better spend your time reading the warrior elite by dick couch crown new york 2001 for the best description as to what really goes on in this training ring the bell demi ,0
what a bad movie i m really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this if you re going to make a movie that involves baseball and shows scenes of baseball at least make the action look somewhat realistic why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games possible spoiler and the last scene in the movie what was that we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an umpire s uniform and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie 3 stars out of 10 ,0
when a man who doesn t have alzheimer s can t remember how many films he s made he probably is the world s most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of so called eurotrash his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed opaque stupid lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the film s title is misleading for starters as any other franco film i ve seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility a generous way with the baldly outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while you re mostly waiting for them to end because they re so very tedious devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america there s lots of naked writhing dancing and endless repeated zoom ins on an ugly totem pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are franco s main methods of extending a film out to feature length the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree and it s hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her genitals sweet jesus anyway the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers the flakey guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklyn american half english liverpudlian and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest not too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty sluggishly studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the nebulous action is fleshed out haha by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero but it s gotta be done at some point and it s nice to note that the director will show anyone s genitals on camera the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film making but he doesn t muck around with sets you get real islands jungles helicopters and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam ultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot if you re trying to see all the video nasties you will have to watch this at some point and you ll be made as restless as i was if you like franco you ll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are you ll never come across this film copies of it aren t just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it it s franco lazy crazy franco ,0
i like breillat s movies but this one is the best i ve seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence anne parillaud is electric and the script is amazing especially considering it s supposed to take place on the set of another of breillat s movies you don t have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power try to imagine a male director with jeanne s openness not impossible but a little mind bending the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here but not a cold light ,1
well i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here 7 1 now and some of the good reviews usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score though in this case i was very much deceived the movie is a present day detective story with vinnie jones as the investigator journalist who investigates the death of a construction worker mixed with this is a made up dickens novel called the riddle set in the 18th or 19th century which also deals with a murder story both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript sounds interesting it could have been however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas 1 acting mediocre at best but it is watchable no worse than your average uk sitcom though for a movie one expects a little better especially with a score of over 7 2 music the music used is simply horrible it distracts and it is annoying especially the pub music and the music which plays in the journalist s apartment 3 storyline this is a big joke there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it s almost funny furthermore without going into any detail i can safely say that the ending is absurd and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year 4 camera work at times camera positions and views are distracting and serve absolutely no purpose to the story i m a bit of a movie fanatic and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day but this is easily the worst movie i ve seen in months don t waste your money or your time on this rubbish ,0
hartley on low key form martin donovan born to play jesus comes as messiah to millenial manhatten p j harvey is excellent as sidekick magdelena a slight film but drily amusing short and sweet ,1
the story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie then the story gets more and more outrageous the main character portrayed by marina sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role this could have been a super great movie had the ending been more realistic ,1
i ve just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4 disc 26 episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film television archive s more entertainment inc so far aside from the 1st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb mr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it 5 years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if you re in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head you ll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and well executed and even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it ,1
i love b movies but i like to be aware from the beginning that i m watching one i can t believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad aliens and predator are awesome this movie made a big joke out of them the creators didn t take this movie seriously at all i am throughly disappointed in how the strauss jerks handled this film they made a mockery of amazing characters it s like they were trying to be serious in the beginning then their writers got high and gave up almost nothing was continuous the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and predators seriously anymore these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves,0
 the cure is a very touching and poignant drama the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends one of the boys has aids the boys become good friends despite erik s apprehensiveness at first the film shows the boys journey to discover the cure which is in ohio according to the national examiner and how it affects their relationship the acting is wonderful i have never seen annabella sciorra do better and the movie is just plain touching i couldn t stop crying with the shoe scene this is a good tearjerker keep the kleenex nearby 8 10,1
i first saw this one when it was first shown so i m not too objective about it it really managed to scare me partly because it was so late at night but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story the same thing that helped dark shadows itself and the casting was so right i hardly know shane briant from anything else so it might not be so right to call him well cast but to me he is dorian gray and as far as the other male actors the one who fit his part so well was nigel davenport who s so good at larger than life characters as sir henry and john karlen a sort of dan curtis repertory player at the time because of dark shadows as one poster points out this version manages to include the involvements with men in a fairly subtle way the scene where dorian recites a list of men s names to john karlen s character as a way of blackmailing him and the look on karlen s face were very well done if that scene were done now it would probably be done in a too obvious way and be bad by comparison i saw it when dorian gray was barely a name to me let alone more so even more than the famous 1945 version which is rightly famous this is the version to me ,1
this has always been a favorite movie of mine i ve owned a vhs copy and a couple of months ago i found a dvd release which is also part of my video collection i also happen to be a huge baseball fan and as part of my off season reading i picked up a copy of robert whiting s excellent book you gotta have wa that profiles the ins and outs of japanese baseball and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in japan as i began to read yesterday it made me think of this movie because it appears the screenplay was based almost verbatim on this book the parallels are uncanny the jack elliot character closely resembles bob horner an aging mlb slugger whose best days were behind him horner s teammate leon lee is also depicted in the character max hammer dubois a veteran in the japanese league who has made his peace with the frustrations of the japanese game and helps keeps his teammate sane the elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as horner from big fanfare signing early success that fuels an already ravenous sports media and the ensuing slump that spurs frustration alienation from teammates fans and media and the resulting disillusionment that prompts a desire to go back home to the us the only difference is that the movie adds such hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending speaking of love interests i m sure many viewers have come to this site as i did to look up the actress who played hiroko the beautiful aya takanashi and what other work she has done it only lists this movie it turns out based on an article i read that the brief love scene she has with tom selleck a foreigner in this movie mild by our standards basically they kiss while he s in the bath and she s wearing a towel caused such an outrage on the part of the japanese public males in particular that she has never been offered another role of any kind in movies or television essentially blackballed by the japanese movie industry it s a real shame as she is was quite a talented actress in this movie if you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as i did go find a copy of you gotta have wa by robert whiting a good read and a great companion book to this movie ,1
andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40 ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling out with 2 long time best girldfriends seeing a gigolo gold digger in the sincere young man the girl friends dead set on terminating this silly relationship go over and beyond the call of duty in helping out their friend who obviously is blinded by this gigolo s tricky game a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous far fetched no longer covers it without these unbelievable scenes there may have been hope for a sweet love story instead all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head these things just don t happen without giving away cliff hanger details i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film most like me will be very disappointed on a scale of 1 to 10 this one ranks a weak 4 with me there is much better material out there this one isn t worth your time ,0
a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks my friend grabbed head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie well you guessed it it was me i have never been so embarrised in all my life we got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about 45mins because this was the funniest film in the world i cant remember much about it but one thing i do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every 5 mins that head made me laugh and when i look at other peoples comments aboout this movie it makes me laugh even more head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha,0
this is the best movie i ve seen since white and the best romantic comedy i ve seen since the hairdresser s husband an emotive beautiful masterwork from kenneth branagh and helena bonham carter it is a tragedy this movie hasn t gotten more recognition ,1
soldier isn t a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons but i liked soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me first the art direction is tight and well executed as far as science fiction backdrops go soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre the sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed i didn t love all of their future military style but i was impressed with the effort for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch second i m a kurt russell fan i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero it s not an award winning role but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed this isn t iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre if you haven t seen it and you like sci fi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice just don t expect the next bladerunner ,1
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa s finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon later episodes in the series of which there were four in total were not actually based on original dr seuss material although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style the three sequels were gerald mcboing boing s symphony 1953 how now boing boing 1954 gerald mcboing boing on planet moo 1956 although he also appeared in a later episode of mr magoo ,1
uuuuaaa barf yuk yuk disgusting puke city worst piece of junk ever made sick weird horrible enough said hold your nose don t eat after seeing this sick demented garbage pail of a movie you won t be able to eat your food for a week but maybe that s good a new diet has been invented go to see this vomit inducing film get sick to your stomach and you will be so turned off by the whole mess that you can t eat for at least a week and you drop about 15 pounds me me lay with a name like this it s really amazing that she doesn t have a cult fan following she rates as the worst actress ever her films make ed woods look like gone with the wind this movie rates a minus 10 ,0
i don t know why but when i am asked about bad movies i have seen i often think of the air up there i know that technically lots of movies are horrible compared to it and i have seen worse acting it s just that it s so bland so predictable in a word mediocre ,0
i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 1970 s 1990 s that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn t reprise her role in the film she wasn t well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role the movie plot was true to the play anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind ,0
i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan a culture i know very little about i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint i watched this with someone who didn t read the book and he also enjoyed it they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over you feel for the characters and their plights i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime ,1
according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea audie murphy and randolph scott the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost hadn t been seen in years good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it s out on the open market albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque cleveland is more than just a business owner he s the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair he even has the sheriff in his pocket randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing that includes not backing relatives up when they re villains he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals barbara s great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda randolph scott s original home studio was paramount it was where his first studio contract was with albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one note also lon chaney jr who is george cleveland s chief henchman a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes who is just gabby hayes albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque i m not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market ,1
well as goethe once said there really isn t any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what s been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people don t watch it it s a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i don t mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i don t see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her alexandre s affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre léaud is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he along with the director eustache had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post 68 milieu what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman sleeping mostly in this very flat with another and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world he s chosen to create for himself what i can t however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre veronika and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can t imagine the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities this latter idea however is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if you re historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post 68 parisian milieu which was probably unfortunately not restricted to just a few particularly anti social types like these but please don t make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have ,0
so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie there was just very little excitement the acting was atrocious to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes the church lady for example the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring rather then get the police involved which i m sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them she instead devises a horrible plan to get the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too which the movie then fades to black bad dialog bad acting bad ending ,0
in sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile additionally the film is not really realistic liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover s son by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty ex lover at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball s chance in hell the actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus ,0
who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring d lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one i found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things 2 and death to the supermodels for 2 99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one whoever thought that this straight to video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because i think what pretty much most of the people who ve seen this film thinks what a load of crap ,0
unfortunately many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores adjusted by imdb this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde little big man night moves mickey one and the chase if you click in the user rating area you ll see that the actual median for four friends is 7 6 however imdb has adjusted dumbed down the rating to 6 4 per imdb imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at vote stuffing by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it the exact methods we use will not be disclosed this should ensure that the policy remains effective in other words we won t disclose our methods so you can t question how we arrived at the score what a shame to see fine thought provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb s filters ,1
the things that i find irritating on screen the things i nitpick about and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are those moment where the writer director set designer on screen caterer or whoever doesn t think it through to the end and by a single act of omission or commission undoes all the other work done by everyone else who has worked on the movie that moment of wait a bloody minute what just happened that stops the narrative dead in its tracks not that this film s narrative needed a lot of stopping because anyone who has ever seen it will know that quintet s narrative drive has pretty well frozen solid before the end of the opening shot there are several of those moments in this movie and you get so long to think about them too the film is two hours long and the scripted dialogue probably ran to five pages there s a lot of time to ponder its deficiencies the movie is set in a frozen earth another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying it s cold very cold it s actually very cold on the screen the movie was shot in canada in winter and there are icicles and real snow and people s breath misting from their mouths in every scene time and again we are reminded how fecking cold it is people wear big hats and layers and layers of clothes and waddle around like over dressed weeble people must have been a horrible shoot my nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero checks into a room of a hotel woken up in the middle of the night by voices coming from the room next door he overhears a conversation of vital importance to the meagre plot through an large grill in the wall dividing the two rooms i m not questioning why there is a convenient grill in the wall between the two rooms what got me annoyed was the fact that the grill had not been blocked up by the long term tenant with the noisy visitor if you are trying to keep warm the last thing you need is a huge gaping draughty hole in your wall that leads into an unoccupied unheated room trust me i live like this i watched this film sat on my living room sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle my breath was misting as much as the actors if that whacking great hole was in my wall i d block it up with something maybe not the best choice of movie to watch in an unheated room in midwinter but boy did it make me notice the lousy insulation in the film ,0
heather graham is not just a pretty face she is also an extremely talented actress she adds a unique flavour to the movie overall it s an intelligent and yet compassionate look at love marriage and relationships i thoroughly enjoyed it ,1
i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience the imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising the two leads are great and really carry the film my advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations i rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in brisbane not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that s always good unless it s just that was stupid i loved this film you just don t get to see gem s like this every day this should become a cult favorite give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do ,1
when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is good bad episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don t understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super modern robot who works on two aa size batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super activated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society ,0
i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5 2 10 for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci concerning mr kamar del s reyes i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of time and i m trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is 1 and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o ,0
this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd i loved those six movies they were well acted well scripted and historically accurate i did actually read gregory s book and liked it well enough despite it s huge historical inaccuracies i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular but this movie didn t even mention that that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book above all this movie just leaves me asking why why do we see as someone else aptly put the real world tudor england why are the camera angles so bad in general why is the script so bad i mean i know it was improv but come on the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it s obvious that they re making them up as they go along why are the sex scenes so awkward the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting in the movie they re just bad verging on being absolutely hilarious at one point the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii he s thrusting away and she s got this look on her face that says hm i need to go to the store is he done yet maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick it s just bad why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom she s the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn t get immediately married why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad ,0
well i have to say this movie was probably the funniest movie i have seen all year and i don t exactly mean that in a good way this is probably the most pathetic movie i have seen in a while and yet that s what makes it so hilarious you can tell these people are really trying to act unfortunately for them they aren t doing such a good job making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny aaron carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic this movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying this movie is so bad it s actually good i would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh ,1
laurence olivier merle oberon ralph richardson and binnie barnes star in the divorce of lady x a 1938 comedy based on a play olivier plays a young barrister everard logan who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the london fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home the next day a friend of his lord mere richardson announces that his wife barnes spent the night with another man at the same hotel and he wants to divorce her believing the woman to be oberon olivier panics oberon who is single and the granddaughter of a judge pretends that she s the lady in question lady mere when she s really leslie steele we ve seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time with this cast it s delightful i mean richardson and olivier olivier and oberon that great team in wuthering heights pretty special olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight nervous barrister oberon gives her role the right light touch she looks extremely young here fuller in the face with jean harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her she wears some beautiful street clothes though her first gown looks like a birthday cake and in one gown she tries on with that hair do she s ready to play snow white binnie barnes is delightful as the real lady mere the color in this is a mess and as others have mentioned it could really use a restoration definitely worth seeing ,1
bobby and mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life soon after the family settles in their mom marries the king who ends up being an abusive stepfather especially to bobby so bobby decides that he will fly away from the abuse in his birthday present this movie was difficult to watch especially the abuse scenes it was hard to watch an innocent playful little boy become abused and turn into a sullen scared and withdrawn young man the acting is excellent i cried throughout the last half of the movie there were some funny scenes in it too like the monster brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles i wouldn t suggest letting little kids watch it it was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away ,1
not many people remember the carey treatment and i can t say i blame them blake edwards did this during his lean years i e between pink panther movies and for a story of a doctor turned detective coburn working to solve a murder in his hospital it s actually pretty forgettable coburn is dependable as always and o neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings the story twists and turns aren t very involving and even the climax which is supposed to be nerve wracking is gut wrenching instead a missed opportunity altogether and an unfortunate one at that since it was based on a michael crichton book oh well at least crichton didn t write a sequel to it one star carey on coburn ,0
perhaps it s about time we declare 2007 to be the international year of the cinematic crocodile the ridiculous primeval came first about a croc named gustave ruling the swamps in burundi then there was lake placid 2 a low profiled and made for tv sequel to a forgettable original thirdly there s this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of aussie horror and finally i have yet to see the promising rogue the last one is likely to be the best considering the involvement of the upcoming aussie horror talent greg mclean wolf creek black water certainly isn t a complete waste of time and film but it s another pretty pointless survival flick that confuses real life agony with horror pardon my bluntness especially since i honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas it doesn t take too long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile capsizes their little boat and devours the guide grace lee and adam barely manage to escape the reptile s hungry teeth by climbing up a tree even though he remains unseen most of the time the croc patiently lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive yes it does sound an awful lot like the plot of open water indeed replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable aussie swamp and there you have it oh well black water at least features some rare moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster it has to be said the croc looks fabulously groovy and you anxiously count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water the three headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time the based on true events concept obviously causes a number of restrictions like limited images of the fantastic filming locations dialogs and amiable character drawings ,0
i find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid but i admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool i find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws d urville martin broke funny speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set this film looks like fun when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen scorsese lucas capra i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first ,1
well it looked good on paper nick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie da vinci code american history 101 and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed 2 is to speed a reasonable cast including john voight and harvey keitel battles against a puerile script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemasons however these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar and nobody mention from hell or jack the ripper i don t think i ve revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour ,0
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is resting at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james finlayson phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross eyed repairman the doctor comes in for a check up and after some tests he recommends drinking goat s milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan practises some trumpet playing hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his trumpet meanwhile the newspaper s front page reads that killer nick grainger escaped convict richard cramer has escaped and he sneaks onto the boys boat while they are sleeping and the goat chews through the boat rope drifting out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts choking on something stan blows his trumpet to help and ollie s rage gets him punching the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have ollie s rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moments of comedy but it isn t a great black and white film well here s another nice mess you ve gotten me into was number 60 on 100 years 100 quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian okay ,0
the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one as clark griswold wins a trip for the whole family to europe the tasteless below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here that fault surely lies with director hackerling who s obviously nowhere near as good a director as harold ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around the cast does what they can chevy chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it s simply not enough and the very funny eric idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky englishman some potentially hilarious moments aren t played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated all depictions of europeans are one dimensional and almost universally not funny at all like how the english are sooo polite apart from a few scenes there s hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick but if you re a chevy chase fan like myself the film is watchable but no more than that ,0
for a no budget movie this thing rocks i don t know if america s gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non hollywood the actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooo i ve seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i ve seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors ,1
contains spoiler the movie is a good action comedy but i don t know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast the end of the movie come the bad guy dies and that s it the special effects are good and i don t regret paying to see it at the theatre ,1
i just caught an episode about brad the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started i have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart breaking than his drug addiction here s this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks and immediately upon arriving he insults lance armstrong one of the greatest athletes who ever lived and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general understandably he is soon asked to leave most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back but what i wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass at any rate i was confused about how the show was put together since it shows brad at the height of his addiction we see footage of him pan handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine i didn t even know that was legal to show but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good tv episode at any rate it is an enlightening show because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people s lives sometimes it s hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict s indifference although i have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean cut there are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost but still and maybe i should warn about spoilers here everything has a little too much of a happily ever after feel at the end and i have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life but still it s a show about people trying to help other people and you can never complain too much about something like that ,1
this film infuriated me for the simple fact that it was made only because shepherd was gay the men who murdered him are clearly wicked what happened to the poor man was truly horrible and a tragedy however where was hollywood when four religious white kids were executed after being forced to perform a host of sex acts on their killers and each other by two evil black men in wichita just two years ago the celebrities only mug for the camera when it serves a political purpose also laramie is portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo documentary which of course is hardly surprising because they are the backward hicks who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened californians still it s always a treat to see laura linney ,0
i remember loving this show when i was a kid i thought the helicopter was the coolest thing i ve seen it was ultra high tech for it s time it could repel enemy fire do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and take down nearly anything in it s way now i go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is the casts members are hardly compelling there are a lot of cheesy moments and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking and nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage lot of the footages appear to date from the vietnam war era airwolf has basically the same theme as knight rider except the crime fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car after watching a few episodes i found myself utterly bored i do however love the theme music ,0
before i start let me say that i fully believe in god i believe in heaven and in hell kay now that thats out of the way i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves hosts think they are doing the last time i checked a host doesn t discriminate spew hatred filled rants on tv or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel all of these that crazy idiotic conservitive bible thumping fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily i am all for free speech but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of soooo many problems one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn t give us any work and we against many of us s will watched 700 s club and of course that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible and he said simon along the lines of god says homosexuality is a sin and i actually heard a kid go hmm i guess he s right wtf seriously if the host is trying to make people think that someone else s sexual orientation is a huge sin then they seriously need to take that host duct tape them and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic ,0
dragon hunters has to be the best looking animated film i ve ever seen it was jaw dropping the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash their weird furry blue dog that pees fire and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler an impossibly immense dragon but honestly it doesn t even matter what the film is about because it is jaw droppingly gorgeous the gravity in this fantasy world is different so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike and there are forests of floating lily pads the world is so creative so uniquely beautiful with a sort of muted storybook look to it the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings the monsters are visually stunning as well like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats some of the plot isn t too original like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world but the gorgeous graphics some seriously sinister scenes and emotion evoking dialog makes this film spectacular ,1
the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists it should actually be called dino crap there is nothing good about this movie even the actors are not worth a penny don t waste your time watching this movie the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie i mean isn t he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut and paste stuff and its the same old story man plays god creates some creature it escapes and is happy eating people and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it bla bla u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie,0
 sky captain and the world of tomorrow an amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it yes the cgi backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus additionally the movie uses music the same way as say gilligan s island or the scooby doo cartoons it never stops terribly simply terrible there are no fresh ideas either just gobs and gobs and gobs and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials there is no gatekeeper here the movie just seems to exist because it can save your money and your time not entertaining at all ,0
i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re runs i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate the first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history repeating itself jr having a kid like his parents did the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone ex katie and franklin the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t v and beat the stupidity out of him until he s unconscious the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that clarie claimed as a boyfriend the fifth one had to be katie she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her boyfriend franklin like the pushover he was the last but not least was noah gray cabey franklin franklin was just scary it was like watching a terrible combination of urkle and tj henderson only more annoying they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can t act eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly however b f before frank this show was funny and very entertaining ,0
i went into this hoping it would be the thought provoking little gem people have reviewed this as i love indy films and expected to dig this too knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained maybe even see an outsiders perspective all i can say is wow if your into self torture or mutilation then maybe you ll like this personally i don t like the idea of being pee d on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage bad script bad acting bad story bad directing bad editing i could go on i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10 that s misleading and ignorant voting for a movie on imdb isn t setting a precedent it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is ok to watch as long as it s controversial this film is not it tries very hard to be but fails you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically unfortunately they do die but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured do yourself a favor just don t even bother i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for 50 and feel ripped off ,0
this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that replace outer space with the south african desert throw in the same ingredients a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film a group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn t really work and made the film rather boring the creature didn t appear much and when it did it didn t really install a feeling of horror there is one scene where someone gets the flesh ripped from his arm but that was basically it on the gore front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dry i give this film 4 10 and that is only because of the interesting location which alone isn t enough to save this movie from being a total snooze fest,0
film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living only living staying alive in a cruel world a nightmare world we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else they the children of the movie are desensitized they are more than desensitized by what is around them they see sex as an act like they are watching a tv program when the one boy is with the hooker pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare no feeling he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away a human film with human relations and moral judgement in a ugly scared cruel world reminds us that life is not fair but you can still have a human connection ,1
one of the most peculiar oft used romance movie plots is this one a seriously messed up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman who turns his life around before dying occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in the theory of flight an excellent weepie but more frequently it s done like it is here where as usual the heroine dies of old movie disease you know the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you re telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks aren t affected one bit and since this is the 70 s neither is your sex life this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together and they re played by actors who are completely at sea this has got to be the worst performance of al pacino s career and i say that after having seen the devil s advocate only two days ago he plays a control freak emotionally constipated race car driver and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly he seems to constantly be asking himself why he s staying around the grating marthe keller so does the audience and spends most of the movie just standing there usually with his mouth hanging open the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end where his character proves that he s changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation hey it was the seventies marthe keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of say vanessa redgrave or julie christie instead they got the expressionless face and heavy german accent of ms keller who comes across as more of a scary teutonic stereotype you vill eat ze omelet than anything like lovable she s supposed to be reforming pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that but it doesn t work that way it s more like she s harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history where you can t believe she d be with someone she finds so worthless and you can t believe he s with someone who gets on his nerves that much some bad movie fans call this a cult classic mostly because of pacino s silly liberating mae west imitation the scene is a scream especially in context but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for no only see the film if you re a serious bad movie aficionado who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors or very bad casting not only are the leads terrible but pacino s other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes keller with shorter hair i got them totally confused this isn t one of those laugh a minute bad movies like the conqueror it s just a really really bad movie ,0
the beatles had just done magical mystery tour there was the general feel that performance peace and drugs went together naturally in la there was a film subculture that knew something was up nicholson was in several of these gangs before he decided to seriously become an actor before easy rider before pink flamingos before day for night there were several experiments with what to do about this an important one is saragossa manuscript this is another jack writes he plays with circular narrative self reference film reference performance self loathing the pain of creation all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop you must see this if only to know something about jack certain actors act by digging into themselves it is a common technique some dig deep but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people there isn t just enough stuff in there to sustain a career think of deniro and hackman others are pretty interesting people who seem to become more interesting over time when they dig into the barrel they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging think sean penn and jack at the bottom of jack s barrel at the end of the thread he spins as the base of every character is this experimental risky writer filmmaker who cares if it is a bad movie it is bad because it took risks watch when a tear is wiped from annette s cheek by the director it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing something that i heard marlon laughed about that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history there s another reason to watch this music in film is has a strong root in dance revolution in film often relies on music whole cultures are thus swept along an unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this but this is one of her earliest screen appearances you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool daddy s girl segment over one of nilsson s better songs followed by the frank zappa cameo mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later a third reason to watch is early about 6 1 2 minutes in the film a character named lady pleasure kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs she is credited as i j jefferson but is really mimi manchu nicholson s lover at the time and lsd partner red hair psychedelic demeanor lovely that scene says it all for me about how jack feels about the boys ted s evaluation 3 of 3 worth watching ,1
brad pitt sticks his index finger in diane kruger s leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants funny horribly so the invented yarn takes the dirty dozen for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies lots of fun even paris when it sizzles is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog i was thrilled by christoph waltzer s character and by his sensational performance brad pitt creates a true original i love the actor s lack of vanity there s a quirk in the character that is pure brad pitt tarantino visits a new universe but fortunately his hand his brain and his heart are visible all over the place ,1
one of the finest movies i have viewed good script original plot of a man who is haunted about jfk s assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that cold november day in 1963 thirty years later another anti social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president the secret service agent loses his partner along the way to the crazed gunmen who schemes lies and murders anybody in his path who ll stand in his way of his mission the movie accompanies with a great memorable score and a restrained but meaningful romance between russo and eastwood which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work malchovich is great sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played but how many could acted with such craftiness and intellect that he displayed in the movie needless to say i thought this was a great movie everytime it s on television i have to watch it and i own it on dvd i m a big eastwood fan this only boosted his already fabulous career and malchovich s best role to date ,1
what happened those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen nightmare on elm st had gone noticeably downhill after it s cult classic of a first film but i doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film and nobody is more distraught about it than i am this is by far the worst anoes film of the lot it doesn t seem too bad at the beginning with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring alice but then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events i mean sure freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy but this one is like a train wreck in it s poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup it feels like you re coming down with a terrible headache not like you re getting scared so the directing totally fails none of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic the death by food especially except for that one cool scene that s crafted like a comic book battle that s why this movie gets a point the storyline lame lame lame lame it was an excuse to gross people out and to make the mpaa mad and nothing more the acting should i mention how freddy has been turned into a childish boogey man like clown figure how his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old s horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we ve all known and loathed since the first film that arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again ugh and his one liners too throughout the whole movie they suck badly a grade schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film hell a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what freddy s been told to say here who wrote the script for this this movie is really irritating too it seems so pointless like a gnat buzzing around your head a gnat that just won t go away freddy is just an annoyance now we ve seen him so many times before this one s nothing different and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one liners and get off your tv screen alice instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie seems annoying and very shallow and this is obviously due to the horrible horrible script this movie was fitted with lisa wilcox may be a great actor and sometimes it shines through the cracks here but she can t save this movie the other actors just suck mostly the last 15 or 20 minutes of freddy s existence in this film are awful and embarrassing i hope englund was ashamed of this who wants to see freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out laughing like a cartoon villain this movie destroyed anything positive i felt for the nightmare series i can t ever watch them again without this image running through my head of the mangled cartoon abomination that krueger became he was slowly becoming a jokey retarded pop culture icon but this is the lowest of the low this is rock bottom nobody will ever take freddy krueger seriously again after seeing this film he s naught but a joke a clown that is long overdue for retirement pathetic of all the movies i could hate why did it have to be nightmare on elm st a series which i once adored and liked a lot the dream child represents the death of a legend and the shattering of any hope i had in the nightmare on elm st series freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment freddy s dead which was more entertaining than this was actually and then he would go on to bring down the mood in freddy vs jason and finally he would putter out into nothing which is for the best i know this has mostly been a rant about why freddy sucks now but this movie is overall horrible and one of the worst movies ever made not recommended to anyone and even anoes completionists won t want to see this one again ,0
this is based on michael s life from 1983 4 till 2004 flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don t believe he was even though he trusted the wrong people at times i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white i think latoya should of been portrayed in this she was always pictured with her brother in the 80 s i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts there were some things that were inaccurate lisa marie presley s son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child it was katherine s idea for the two to get married ,0
i like both this version of dorian gray and the mgm version both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with dorian this is not in the original book and that is my only complaint i especially like angela lansbury as sybil vane and george sanders as harry in the mgm version but shane briant as dorian in the tv version is much better looking i think and far more ruthless than hurd hatfield in the mgm version i think briant is more true to the novel s dorian in the end this is a very good adaptation of the novel it even hints at dorian s liaison s with men as does wylde which could not be done in the mgm version ,1
this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot i m sure that this film was meant to be campy but the approach was so heavy handed and self reflexive it turned out really flat judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton who i feel embarrassed for this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor a freak accident alters nelson s career course and mayhem ensues the attempts at humor were corny predictable and often base and tasteless wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing comedically or otherwise overall it s a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film one of the all time worst bombs you ll ever witness ,0
i know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won t do as a film about vietnam viet nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out this film stars gene hackman who is korean war vet assigned to train a group of rag tag viet nam vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of american pow s held at a camp there these men include a former tunnel rat a crazy acid dropping sailor a blond tanned surfer from california and some inexperienced kid patrick swayze who just so happens had a dad that was killed in nam they train first at some camp in texas and once in nam they are found out and lose all their weapons they are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men most of the men are found and saved but the rag tag group is mostly wiped out this movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush and who was going to die and who was going to live viet nam i m guessing was not like a video game ,0
what an ambitious project kenneth branagh undertook here and how well it was realized this is the first filmed version of hamlet to use the full text of shakespeare s play but branagh didn t do it just because it was there his intention i believe was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down so to speak in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves a fair enough proposition and one that s a bargain the setting is a generic 19th century european one and this does more than work well it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself the production design and cinematography and both outstanding which helps immensely when you re watching a four hour movie branagh s casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise the direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play since so much of hamlet is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels battles etc this can be a daunting task but everything branagh tries to do seems to work branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor writer directors if not always the best since he made his big splash with henry v one quibble i had with him was what i saw as a tendency to ham it up at times in his portrayal of hamlet here he might be accused of that again but there is a method at work let s face it hamlet is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before he or she needs help even if they ve read the play hamlet has the most lines of any shakespearian character and branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film even if you don t know the literal meaning of every arcane word this performance by branagh was at the very least worthy of an oscar nomination there are so many other outstanding performances here they re almost too numerous to mention but some of them must be acknowledged derek jacobi as claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to kate winslet when it comes to handing out praise her portrayal of ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time she looks to me like the finest young actress around other super performers in no particular order are richard briers nicholas farrell michael maloney and reece dinsdale and timothy spall as guildenstern and rosencrantz respectively honorable mention goes to julie christie charlton heston and robin williams who manages to do his thing here successfully even billy crystal as a gravedigger works the one cast member who doesn t inexplicably is jack lemmon in the very opening scene he appears and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor you know this must have been a real dilemma for branagh since everything else about the movies screams out that it s the work of a perfectionist not to be facetious when speaking of a four hour movie but it does seem just a tad too long some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit if i may be so bold and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome did i forget anything other than patrick doyle s score no doubt i did i ll just sum up by saying that kenneth branagh may have made the definitive film version of hamlet and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one ,1
this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front it is easy to see why fire has caused riots in india but tragic nonetheless a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners ,1
i have to be 100 honest with you fellow imdb users i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster doesn t charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way i m in love with that woman i got what i expected but only half this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations while i don t agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated i must admit that préte moi ta main has plenty of flaws my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters there isn t a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment of romance or even a clue to suggest that they re interested in each other in fact the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward when both are in the couch and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest i didn t buy the dinner sequence still the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days i understand it s a movie and that s why i accept it as a funny situation plus the humor is versatile there are moments involving s m funny lines with chabat s best friend some lesbian references funny situations involving the family women and more charlotte gaionsbourg s performance is top notch and she s by far the reason to watch the movie she s funny sexy looks very thin and fine and demonstrates she s a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance i think the supporting cast do what they can the score art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits it s a good example of feel good cinema ,1
i like movies about ufos which is why i recently decided to rewatch eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late 1970s and now i m compelled to write a review about it because i m afraid i ll start forgetting everything about it fast you see even though ebts ain t bad it s very dull and nondescript the story is sorta interesting but flat the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing the fx are terribly amateurish but i can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling which unfortunately this one ain t also there s very little violence and there s no nudity whatsoever which makes this 1970s italian sci fi opus a true oddity because if there s one thing that distinguishes italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade it s the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them oddly enough because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements ebts stands out from the rest of the pact i don t know if this can be seen as a compliment though personally i can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but i think ebts needed more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry and the special effects aren t that special the story itself is actually interesting it s a combo of the x files and antonioni s blowup a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country the aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth the problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer s apartment this taking place just before she s to be abducted herself the man takes some of the negatives and leaves with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives the whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives the majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue in the spy vs spy variety the ufo element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war mcguffin but as dull as eyes behind the stars is it does resemble the x files a lot i wonder if chris carter saw this movie anyway the best thing in ebts are the pov shots which are creepy and effective but the rest is almost completely forgettable including the goofy looking aliens even though i ve been mostly negative about this film i sorta cherish it nonetheless i still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when i saw it as a kid and i own the video the film could have been so much more if it had been done properly oh well ,0
it s a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning a middle and a end a nice clever mystery with an appealing heroine for all ages who wins us over with her wit and charm andrew fleming s film is indeed a modern marvel a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in hollywood he puts away the over reliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film with a very capable young actress and a talented supporting cast the film is based on the old books but it has been given updated enough to put in this century however the props might be different the heart still is a good mystery and there is clever one here one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth emma roberts is an old fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others details that are sorely missing from today s films she is still good enough to get boys attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect she earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little guile when it is needed to achieve her goals while taking a vacation to california our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play suddenly she is visited by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the california scene and this is well presented without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual eventually the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences from the young ones to the adults in the audience it is a movie that deserves to be seen appreciated and enjoyed a film that is rare and delicate and it s not afraid to be classified as fun five stars,1
i ve seen some very terrible horror movies in my time and while this isn t the worst of the bunch it s certainly in the lower half the script starts off ok a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife cute huh the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients turns out that there s a demon on the basement that s harvesting people s souls it s the job of the 1 doctor 1 nurse and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid i was begging for it to be over there was still an hour to go it looked like a half an hour tales from the crypt episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap fest from tiny lister doing his best john coffey the green mile impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet this movie fails in every possible level i gave this 2 stars for only two reason 1 his fiancé is pretty hot she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 the movie actually looks ok a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal mart quality home cameras in the end avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass which i do and i still felt cheated as a bonus drinking game you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi dr james bishop shakes his head while talking you ll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie ,0
enormous suspension of disbelief is required where will s genius is concerned not just in math he is also very well read in economic history able to out shrink several shrinks etc etc no no no i don t buy it while they re at it they might as well have him wearing a big s on his chest flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets among other problems real genius shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such mindless homage doesn t simply appear ex nihilo it isn t ever so multi faceted and it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries better to have made will a basketball prodigy except that damon s too short ,0
i really have to disagree with guy yardley rees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feel i can t say how much standard films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again seachd doesn t seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film ok so the acting isn t in the style a blockbuster that s because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautiful seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around that really do feed into the ending overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please ,1
spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain s guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone plates dr james cameron s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn t apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn t believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding azaria s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book shook me for that reason and i ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone s guilt ever since excepting oj of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don t think it could have been done better i ve always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think it s not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didn t receive more publicity at the time it was released ,1
having first read the novel i don t mind for the purposes of filming how differently it is scripted as long as it adheres to or at least includes the plot for reasons known only to hollywood important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story line added the reason this novel passed the test of time is no doubt due to the interweaving of both the characters and plot as a whole to interfere with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line and therefore the intension of the story teller although a matter of opinion the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired characters described as very fat should at least be made to look portly to allow for the character to have credibility the days of slavery can t be over or surely actors of this calibre would have been in revolt at such a travesty of the story the face of marian halcolme is described as being manly in appearance tara fitzgerald s very feminine appearance doesn t ring true again laura fairly is described as being fair if not ethereal so with dark hair she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel badly done hollywood j hunter,0
zachary scott does what he does best i e plays a worm in danger signal a 1945 b movie also starring faye emerson mona freeman and rosemary decamp scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money on the lam from his last murder he rents a room in the home owned by the fenchurch family hilda emerson and her mother mary servoss scott throws himself at emerson and she s dazzled mid romance her younger sister anne freeman comes home from a medical treatment when she mentions that she was uncle wade s favorite and he left her 25 000 big bucks by 1945 standards scott loses interest in poor hilda and makes a play for anne anne looks like rebecca of sunnybrook farm until she starts sneaking around with scott overnight she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister finally getting the message that her tenant is no good hilda calls in a psychiatrist rosemary decamp to psyche him out and advise her psychological dramas were all the rage during and after world war ii and scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath this was his forte as a weak willed sheriff in flamingo road he exhibited no real presence as for two timing we saw him do that in mildred pierce where he proved himself particularly good at it emerson is a bookish stenographer with her hair pushed off her face and her big glasses but after hours she s lovely and gives a strong performance decamp was always an underrated actress here she sports a soft german accent and is delightful this is a highly entertaining film though a very routine story the acting truly elevates it ,1
boasting the title for the sickest film ever made pink flamingos is an undisputed classic sure the camerawork is shaky and off center the story is muddled and slow paced and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable but pink flamingos has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can match while this film is indeed an offensive one reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it only john waters can succeed in making rape murder sadism cannibalism coprophagia and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious this movie must be seen to be believed ,1
i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for oscar my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it and i really found what i expected a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in turkey trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all but it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody therefore film stays as average for all whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours to fit the short story in a full movie length some scenes are added without a connection with the main story these are mostly the ice cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people i e goat herdsman old women etc and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs the subject is mentioned as a universal problem struggle of a local producer tradesman against holding companies and monopoly but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before most of the readers will remember the hero grocer against supermarket from ferhan sensoy in 1980 s this was the correct story at correct time shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now except some gibbers due to local accent the performance of cast is so successful the leading role is played by turan ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too on the other hand against limited budget appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo realists or worth to be oscar nominee note in the real life normally the ice cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of manda brand ,0
first off i m a huge fan of 80s movies and of jennifer conelly as well so yesterday i wandered into a local used book movie store and found a vhs copy i read the back and it sounded good and for 3 99 it was a good deal so i took it home and popped it in the vcr what a sweet movie at my age now i relate more to movies like about last night or st elmo s fire but still i remember what it was like to be 15 16 and in love with an older guy etc we all have those little crushes when we re younger and if it doesn t work out we re heartbroken and we think that we ll never get over it but of course we do many times it s that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie the feeling of oooh i remember when something like that happened to me is all through it the characters are interesting and well developed i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies teen films in particular or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives ,1
superhero movie 2008 is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which i despise so much i wish this movie could be the death of the genre but i know that it isn t awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than superhero movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it in superhero movie has a decent cast of c list celebs it s got drake bell the kid from disney s drake and josh leslie nielson airplane tracy morgan snl and 30 rock and a few others scattered throughout although it has the star power to light a 40 watt bulb the movie fails to utilize any humor this movie is about 80 minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot and not one single joke is funny i didn t laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time don t see this movie don t even think about it for the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one oh who am i kidding they ll probably come out with another one by fall ,0
artemesia takes the usual story about the art world eg you can t paint that but i want to and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkable the story is about one of the first female painters around artemesia who course is fiercely independent but just can t stop thinking of men and their bodies for artistic purposes of course she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist but soon tutoring becomes much more then art and soon after that scandal erupts funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft porn fantasy i mean was artemesia that much of a man hungry person also it s quite funny when she s insisting that she paints for herself yet falls for the first person she sees actually the story itself is quite fascinating and it ends with a trial which i always love but i wasn t too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn t fall for i woulda gone for the young fisherman p:P,0
this one features an interesting way of handling a camera espercially for a dtv movie the version i saw was full screen but it falls short on the scenario department first you getaround 20mn of talk talk talk in a would be hip post trainspotting way then it s slasher city and then comesthe most dishonest cheat ending i ve seen much worse than april fool s day where at least it made sense so all inall it s the old song and dance interesting director trieshard but deserves better movie funny usually it is the actors which are in desperate need ofsomething better skip it anyway for your time,0
 queen of the damned is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen the movie had suspense action and gore the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star very well acted by stuart townsend makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create i m always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if queen of the damned is worthy i tell them it s worthy of buying this movie is most for sure a must have in all horror movie lovers homes ,1
interferencia starts as unemployed martin sanders andres bagg hears something strange on his phone he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named diana arranging to meet her soon after martin reads a local paper sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered thinks back to what he heard martin confides in his friends laura virginia lustig aaron oliver kolker but they don t believe him then shortly after the same thing happens again the phone call the man the prostitute her death reported in the papers martin decides he has to find the killer put a stop to his killing spree but who is it this argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days why so long on a budget of about 3 000 why so much was written directed by sergio esquenazi i cannot believe some of the glowing comments interferencia has on the imdb out of 195 user ratings as i write this 113 of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10 i am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10 if a score for a film on imdb is fixed then this is it i honestly don t believe that if you showed interferencia to 195 average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect no way on earth the user comments are also amazingly positive all by imdb users who have only wrote comments for one film this the one user besides me who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right everyone is entitled to an opinion but i would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up where do i start how on earth can i adequately describe how bad interferencia is the plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it s terrible twists while most twists turn a plot on it s head alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever relevant way are genuine surprises here in interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film makes it utterly pointless in a it didn t actually happen sort of way the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers what made martin go mad why did he imagine the phone calls why did he imagine a killer why did he imagine the newspaper headlines no explanation is given for martin s behaviour during the first hour or so of the film there s just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind that s it that s all the exposition there is then there s a plot twist about martin s missing wife her lover before martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason i am sorry but interferencia is so bad it s so boring it s so badly written thought out that i honestly can t think of a positive thing to say about it sorry guy s but that s how i feel quite simply interferencia is one of the worst films i have ever seen is a complete mess both conceptually technically according to the imdb interferencia was hot in just eight days to be honest it doesn t feel like that at all nope it feels more like it was shot in five days the whole film is an eyesore interferencia has probably the worst nighttime shooting i have ever seen it s like no attempt was made to light the scenes it s like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything the scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft becomes increasingly irritating this strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring noticeable there s no real horror or scares in fact i would say interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror as far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge a knife is stuck in someones mouth nothing else according to the imdb this had a budget of about 3 000 which makes interferencia one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window we should accept any old crap wrong to watch this on dvd you will still have to pay good money i personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product if this can get released praised like it s oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage including embarrassing karaoke footage scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap win top prizes at the next cannes film festival the acting is awful although the female lead virginia lustig is actually rather sexy helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit interferencia is an absolutely terrible film seriously i beg you don t be fooled by all the fake positive comments there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10 an amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through sorry but that s the way i see it sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind you have been warned

sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition these three tales aren t anything as good as any from the original creepshow by far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down watch the original creepshow instead or if you already have done then be happy with that ,0
what the beep is going wrong with disney the last years are there totally run out of good ideas where is the magic where are the good animators the good songwriters the good directors the good okay i know walt himself and the famous nine old man can t come back but is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney i never rent or bought a disney sequel of what movie however because i had read much enough about its absence of quality but atlantis milo s return was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it it confirmed my doubts about sequels it was absolutely boring flaw animation primitive color rotation simple characters some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous multiplane camera with cgi mediocre music and a patchwork of different simple stories it looks absolutely not like disney not like disney i know it looks like one of the countless cheap and simple animation series like dragonballz beyblade etc that aired every day on tv for children my first reaction after showing this crap was to load bambi in my dvd player to see disney s immortal magic depth spirit and charm again to see disney on its climax again to see the awesome art of handmade animation again bambi was the first and until today the only movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars but atlantis milo s return no magic no depth no charm no spirit it deserved only 3 out of 10 ,0
i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing female trouble on ifc i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it then i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set the movie is about babs johnson the filthiest person alive who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother and her deranged son crackers in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens drag queens people eating feces torture and all other sorts of random humiliation the film has a soundtrack from 60 s rock and roll artists the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring i found female trouble a little more fun rated nc 17 for explicit sex violence and disturbing images enjoy ,1
watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film thankfully the movie was entertaining suspenseful and realistic there never is the perfect crime and armored showed why the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals the last hour of the film is very entertaining matt dillon is still a very good actor hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age i would buy this movie i give armored eight out of ten not a christmas movie did i write ten lines yet nope anyways there is not to many action films armored has a lot of excitement in it which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy ,1
wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect tradeoff ,1
far from providing the caffeine kick you d expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy boosting of warm beverages coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale indeed if the movie was a cup of coffee it d be rather weak and watery littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste sporadically it hits the spot but otherwise it isn t the hot action drama it hopes to be plot wise coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug pushing lady pimpin mob suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved sick state socio political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in america is prominent in coffy and it makes for some thought provoking stuff as coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted afro american minorities sadly the timely messages are undermined by the film s poor quality and lack of focus coffy s ideas are important it s just that they are not well aimed one of the plus points of coffy is the presence of blaxploitation icon pam grier grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence how do you deal with a house full of hoods drive the car right through the front door it s just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible the low budget can t have helped but neither does the fact that for a blaxploitation flick coffy lacks groove just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection the total result is workmanlike and wooden we get a hip heroine but not a hip movie it s a shame as coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the blaxploitation craze it just never ascends above being an average lukewarm number ,0
i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie instead i based my judgments on a friend s opinions now i like chris rock and his comedy but this movie just falls flat on its face during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one and it that endeavor it fails the love story in the movie is straight forward luckily but it detracts too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland after all the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy where laughter should be the primary concern not much of that in the movie the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole some parts were discontinuous altogether if the supporting cast were meant to be funny they certainly didn t do a good job the couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes which were dry and dull rock s first incarnation s couple of underlings were also bland if there s one thing they did do right though they made rock seem funnier by comparison ,0
this movie is somehow showing 6 2 stars it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations i am at a loss to explain this avoid this movie at all costs you have only a certain number of hours on the earth don t waste 1 1 2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano there is no story as apparently the director wrote and i m guessing with a blunt orange crayon the next day s script at the completion of the day s shooting the story has been called whimsical no it is aimless there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial don t you hate ads now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here and similarly the writer director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work toy love so to recap even if you get this movie for free even if you re paid to watch it avoid it to paraphrase monty python s search for the holy grail run flee ,0
when i found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses meryl streep and wynona ryder i went through the roof but i had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and i still have the bruise first of all the character that jeremy irons an actor i still admire even after this disappointment plays was just awful he treated his family like crap especially his sister played by glenn close i could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and i m no prude but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down wynona and antonio s characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate and what was with meryl s character and her mystical powers why didn t they go into this more this film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here ,0
another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it s another worthy installment my only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two though that might be because of a glorious lack of disk swapping roll on mi4 ,1
 victor doesn t have much but that s not stopping him from trying to go out with judy the prettiest girl on the block all he s got is hope and a one bedroom apartment he shares with his family his grandmother doesn t trust him his brother worships him and his half sister just declared war but victor thinks love really can conquer all in this warm genuine and touching romantic comedy about life in the part of the city most people never see according to the dvd sleeve s synopsis peter sollett raising victor vargas elicits engaging debut performances from lead actor victor rasuk as victor vargas and the cast mr rasuk and juicy judy marte as judy gonzalez are sexy and endearing as lower east side kids discovering the joy of sexual attraction considering how attractive they look in this picture it s not hard to predict they hook up and although you may wonder how innocent they really are their characterizations seem true victor s brother nino is played by victor s real life brother silvestre rasuk who looks the part his older brother is playing sometimes it s nice to see movie brothers who actually look alike and hopefully they will work together again cuckoo for cocoa puffs sister krystal rodriguez as vicki and old world altagracia guzman as grandma round out the sex starved dominican immigrant family so are hand held camera coming of age films in vogue or what raising victor vargas 5 16 02 peter sollett victor rasuk july marte silvestre rasuk,1
you gotta love the spaghetti western universe the vision of a west where good guys get shot point blank with no warning cartoonish villains chew the scenery in extreme close ups and the anti hero walks away from the girl in the end a lot of people call corbucci s films depressing i find that a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go i think bleak and unforgiving are more apt mostly because depressing suggests a level of sentimentality almost every eurowestern director ignored in favour of painting characters in broad strokes gli specialisti must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the sergio corbucci canon it s a beautiful movie and it makes sense that corbucci wanted to blow off some steam with companeros after the unremitting one two punch of the great silence and this although he would later revert back to his usual tricks with the foulmouthed sonny and jed there s still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the overall grimness of the movie imo it hurts more than does any good to have a needless inclusion of three kids dressed like hippies skulking around town in search of gold and trouble and it hurts to have mario adorf playing mexican one handed bandit el diablo as over the top as he always plays his characters those minor gripes aside there s more than enough here to wet the palate of the spaghetti aficionado shootouts galore the population of an entire town reduced to crawling naked in the dirt the typical iconic badassitude of the laconic antihero played by johnny halliday the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the movie corbucci might never receive the acclaim of the more famous sergio or the american patriarchs of the genre but you and i know that s a gross injustice for a very talented director his dynamic shot selection in depth staging with objects sticking close to the camera and receding in the background his flair for quick pacing and feverish energy in moving a story that wasn t always all that along the way he photographs open spaces everything in his work makes me sure that if corbucci was american and had emerged 15 years later along with mann and hawks the cahiers du cinema critics would have lauded him as an auteur worthy of serious critical consideration ,1
my mother told me not to go to see kadosh but who ever listens to one s mother i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater so i checked with card carrying feminists the next day no they also thought it was much more an anti orthodox screed than a pro feminist statement painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra orthodox messianists it is so nasty as to be unbelievable plus that the non fanatic orthodox rock n roller one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy even in israel that must be fantasy the theater was quite crowded so there s a pent up curiosity to see israeli movies too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies originally written 4 29 2000 ,0
the opening credits are pure poetry and i have watched it several times it had a corny 20 s adventure feel to it of course kathy is gorgeous but that voice did she realize this was a talkie one word voice coach great film for chronic insomnia along with a bottle of scotch ,0
i ve always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great writer director also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memories it s so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long it s also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sit com this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasn t expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it ,1
i wait for each new episode each re run with anticipation the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg 1 is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season 9 should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season you cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool ,1
i saw conrack on a night i couldn t sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the carolina s is a great advertisement for teaching and for simply helping each other set in the early 60s with the civil rights issues viet nam and all that came with the 60s it is forgotten that the peace corps and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the unprivileged conrack with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power s that be the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves maybe hopefully see this film ,1
john van druten s bell book and candle is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern day witches living in new york city it was obviously an attractive movie property it had a stellar part for gillian holroyd for her erstwhile book publisher enforced sweetheart shepherd henderson and her madcap family and circle including shep s bewildered fiancée the hateful merle kittredge against whose chances with shep gillian begins her magical spell casting it even had pyewacket a siamese cat familiar with well timed miaows sidney redlitch a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners in short it seemed to its producer perhaps box office magic and so it proved to be so many things were right about its production it only had one element not perfect but i found the rest to be amusing charming and very consistently entertaining to begin with the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include greenwich village and other areas of new york s scene the technical production was beautiful with cinematography by the legendary james wong howe a fine score by george duning more than clever sets by louis diage and gowns by jean louis in the attractive cast were wolfe barzell howard mcnear janice rule as merle ernie kovacs as redlitch jack lemmon as gillia s mischievous brother wonderful comediennes elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment he did well with the comedic portions of his part but he was never convincing as a new york book publisher and a bit too old for the part of henderson anyhow but director richard quine used subtle lighting pace changes and unusually composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation the plot s main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson who does not believe in witches at all she started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée her stuck up college rival later when henderson tries to walk out he keeps coming back to her and realizes he is under a spell as she has apologetically tried to explain to him meanwhile sidney redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson of course he knows nothing at all of magic but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all but gillian s brother enlightens him all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powers which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal of course he never really wanted to resist her anyhow the film has sprightly dialogue charm and a little magic of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments gillian must undergo in her battle with herself and to win the man she loves a lovely ending to this beautifully photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism though a fantasy just about complete in my view memorably delightful ,1
there s not really that much wrong with crash of the moons basically it s a few episodes of rocky jones space ranger merged into a film it is extremely dated however winky s treatment of vena is a good example of this one has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950 s in this respect it succeeds if you like children s sci fi from the 1950 s go ahead and take a look at it you ll see john banner in a pre sgt schultz role he does a pretty good job in it all in all i d give it a 6 out of 10 not great but not bad ,0
when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color that s how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle don t just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you ,1
i saw this movie when it aired on the wb and fell in love with riley smith immediately i would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more i wish they d air it again or cast riley smith in another movie ,1
i chuckled a few times during this movie i laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover pun intended there are three segments in this movie the first one is supposed to be a spoof of woman grows up and launches career movies the tampax box was the funniest thing in this segment most of the cast members aren t listed here on imdb they are the lucky ones few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers the second segment is a spoof of sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry movies robert culp has several funny moments all physical humor including the aforementioned handover after his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as dominique corsaire rises higher and higher by the time she becomes first lady i wanted to rip the cable out of the tv and watch snow i switched to pakistani music videos instead i don t understand urdu or whatever language the videos were in it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull story then came municipalians with the big stars half of them on screen for less than a minute elisha cook jr christopher lloyd rhea perlman henny youngman julie kavner richard widmark and robby benson it s supposed to be a spoof of young cop teams with hardened substance abusing older cop who needs retirement badly movies the horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive it was interesting seeing old rtd buses and a shell gas station sign and an american savings sign none of them are around anymore nagurski s never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car made me smile momentarily then they discuss how boring the young cop is a lot back and forth about how boring he is that was as boring as this description of how boring it is nagurski s law number four never go into a music store that s been cut into with an acetylene torch made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave thinking about that was more interesting than the set up for the gag which followed young falcone benson gets shot a lot he becomes a hardened cop like nagurski the segment keeps going on and on and on it won t stop it rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he d just die already so this thing will end it doesn t it goes on and on and on then a buffy the vampire slayer episode which i ve seen four times already comes on thank god this abysmal movie ended while i went to get the mail ,0
what a fun b movie shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original he really brought me back to the monsters of the 80 s the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesn t matter because it never once takes itself seriously from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow this is truly a b movie gem grab some refreshments snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow films sure they re not for everybody but to each his own sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile ,1
i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len cariou in the sweeny todd role i ve shared the play with many some finding the subject a bit sick but none having anything but praise for the songs i ve always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george hearn as well as hearn and edmund lyndeck as judge turpin i must own the dvd ,1
you should never ever even consider to watch this movie it is absolutely awful this isn t an overstatement it is so unbelievable and exaggerated it gets boring it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one they writer hasn t been able to pull it off in a good way if you d like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ears and just watch it s not worth listening p there are so many great movies out there and if i could choose one this would be the last movie i would pick but all in all it s your choice enjoy ,0
this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago i ve watched it at least 20 times the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines on the plus side it s the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies ,0
i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in 1956 looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more restrained and correct than say blue soldier the environmental anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with wolves the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo killing fields of the late 1800s probably because those in the movie were real killing fields the movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls so the animals you see are really being shot the bones are real in conclusion a very under rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot ,1
zarkorr is one bad movie this doesn t even rate in the so bad its good category it s just bad from the lack of set design to the acting to the special effects everything about this movie stinks for starters the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an oscar candidate and to top it all off there s the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage the towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew s train set so obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer the only good thing about the movie is the monster suit its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film and maybe a decent script would have helped too ,0
myself and my groovadelic 20 something pals just can t get enough of this awesome parker posey classic i tried renting this on dvd but can t seem to find it too bad as i m sure the features would be extra special we all highly recommend this uber cool comedy flickerino for a date or even just a cozy night home alone this would also be the purr fect type of movie to watch with your cat or even throw a party based on like a party girl party just like the one in the movie that the lovable huggable squeezable parker posey goes to at the end oh and be on the lookout for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending move aside the sixth sense you ve just been outdone by a way radder movie sorry no offense just calling it like it is take it from an old flick lover comedy just doesn t get better than party girl with parker p feel it yours ronald marie macdougall aka dj cyber rap :),1
eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now it s such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat the first two out regardless of their sex will sleep with each other the 3rd 4th out will have a fight in the vic the 5th one will be arrested the 6th develop an addiction 7th get pregnant etc etc the producers are clever though the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines 1 someone will walk in the vic say what s goin on 2 someone else will stand up say leave it aht out 3 then a woman will say doan choo come in ere n insult mah fam ly that s it that s every show apart from the occasional get it sort id is it sort id the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk their way of life the buffers came off when 1 they extended it from two nights a week 2 the slater family turned up how they attract viewers is beyond me the kat character symbolizes everything that s gone wrong with society treating anyone else like something she s pulled off the bottom of her shoe the people who vote her the best character in these polls must the same as the ones that vote jamie redknapp best sportsman despite the fact he hasn t played a game for 3 years what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave ross kemp martin kemp the list is endless how long has the longest couple s marriage lasted with them being faithful to each other yes people leave but until the script writers realise that characters couple can be interesting likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that and zoe the doctor top even lofty shell as most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv yes eastenders is the most watched show thats undisputed but many external factors contribute to that 19 30 20 00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours and more than that millions of the viewers watch it out of nothing more than habit but if they were completely honest to themselves they would admit that in 2002 more than ever it can be absolutely pitiful ,0
as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together a clue was given right from the start but you ll never realize it until the end it s a simple hook but it works it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations it s a postcard of ny also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it so if you like a good old fashion romantic movie then this is for you ,1
one of the more prominent popular episodes but clearly one of the worst a red shirt female falls for khan instead of dropping dead for a change and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non existent character trait on the ship makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in wink of an eye when a red shirt male takes the enemy s side just because he falls in love same as in ss however in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot this is very silly because it once again makes kirk s crew seem like a bunch of soft headed easy to impress morons who once they fall in love with the enemy are capable of doing just about anything the fact that mcgivers switches back to kirk s side doesn t ameliorate the illogic in any way lord mcgiveth and the lord mctaketh why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength that s one of several st plot devices that undermine kirk s intelligence why does khan hold a knife against mccoy s throat if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself and what s with a sikh being played with a latino accent montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach i was half expecting to hear the plaaain the plaaaain in the background at any moment why the hell would kirk or any ship captain provide limitless use of the ship s library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots ss is a very cartoonish silly episode so no wonder trekkies love it it doesn t have too many sci fi elements in it which is what trekkies hate the most it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie that way pleasing rabid trekkies who were so very disappointed with the first movie which you guessed it had far too much sci fi for the average tiny trekkie brain ,0
imagine if you took the christ myth mixed it with a healthy dose of porn against a backdrop of bad sci fi blackxploitation brotha from another planet like throw in a dash of after school special and lots of really bad kung fu fighting oh and some decent break dancing with an awesome casio keyboard soundtrack and some how they make this even worse than you could imagine there are at least 4 rape scenes at least one great car explosion a buff black guy running around in his undies with an uzi add alcohol and this is the perfect movie i mean lots and lots and lots of alcohol,0
god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i m a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i don t think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron ,0

the minute you give an art film 1 10 you have people baying for your ignorant half ass ed artistically retarded blood i won t try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown cult classic a 10 10 all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this film here is how i would summarize the film opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co incidence this followed by in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain the following a children s game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game show s star contestant decides that he doesn t want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game show s producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as mr producer s second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it rains frogs you read correctly and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a modern epic you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel ,0
there s one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie ,0
men of honor has many great aspects to it good action sequences plenty of feel good scenes a good musical score but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting mostly by robert deniro the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further it is a good story but it seems like it has been done many times before a person against all of the odds won t give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago it could happen but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c o of the diving school tampering with his final test however all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie deniro plays mater chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can t hate unless you have incredible wilpower before the movie ends deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film but admit it if it was all the truth it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes ,1
my father the hero is sweet funny and cute gerard depardiu is awesome as andre a divorced father who takes his fourteen year old daughter nicole kathrine heigl to the caribbean for vacation while there his daughter meets a guy named ben dalton james to impress him she tells him that andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her pimp everyone on the island is soon under the impression that andre s a child molester andre is between two relationships one with isabelle emma thompson who makes a cameo in the end of the film and diana faith prince from spin city my father the hero has many funny moments like when he s at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french so he plays thank heaven for little girls from gigi everyone gets disgusted and leaves my father the hero doesn t deserve a 5 1 i think it deserves a 9 0 ,1
the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many super people movies these years and in fact i really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn t expect uma thurman performed as average in g girl s role surprisingly i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen like in the beginning of kill bill luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman i could really get into his situation if you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch g girl s and average matt s adventures especially to cheer up your partner 7 10 in my collection ,1
this film is outstanding on this date of apr 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time it had been a while since i seen it but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked with a wife that seems close to going her own way the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool paulina porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type looking very fresh and hot trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron eckhart was cool at first and he even loans him his wife s car to take care of some business then he spots nicks silver briefcase and the day changes for the weird and violent there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes but paulina s dallas steals the show i think her telling of a casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application is outrageous as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy but as with any rule there are exceptions paulina is as one has never seen her before in films sexy and lethal like in the one movie with tom selleck but with a never seen before malevolence if your looking for film to add to your collection this one is worth the price paulina in the nude is worth the price alone but this story has everything one might hope one has love friendship sex and violence in a terrific mix when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind and i know you will feel the same way ,1
i really think that this movie is great personally but in every movie there is a downer now some of you may not have watched hilary duff s raise your voice but if you think about it those two shows are very very similar if you know what i mean in brave new girl holly wants so bad to get into haverty conservatory in raise your voice terri wants to go to a conservatory in l a don t remember the name of the conservatory there they are both in the music field and they both have to sing at the ending of the semester it s really funny how these two films are alike i personally like brave new girl better than raise your voice though ,1
i watched this film because i noticed that it had kari wuhrer in the cast i have long had a theory about her that she is a talented actress but never seems to get to prove that because she is always in this sort of low budget b movie she is still beautiful and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in this is no different the film is often ugly and disturbing but that doesn t make it good george wendt played against type and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role another note about ms wuhrer her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since i saw her last perhaps reduction surgery or more likely removal of implants this not a bad thing she still looks great i would like to see her in a better movie ,0
greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja growing in order to pay the bills it sounds promising and the ever reliable brenda blethyn doesn t disappoint but the material is sitcom thin there s actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to give me one a toke and he thinks she s asking for sex and acts all awkward yes it s humour so twee a nun would be bored saving grace doesn t seem to know what it wants to be the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of ryan s daughter whilst the light hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow it does speed up after the first hour but by then it s too clichéd to care the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina i ve ever seen ,0
as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 i ve purchased that s been made recently i wasn t sure what to expect a cambodian hit man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie it s like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking there s no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended ,1
if the following sounds tempting then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie post haste 1 awful 60 s hairstyles from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails 2 the worst child actor in the world ever who does nothing but cry and say daddy in the most annoying voice imaginable 3 lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn t mesh with the film at all 4 stereotypical indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook oh and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire 5 hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set 6 the exterior shots of 5 which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light 7 terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first star trek series look cutting edge by comparison special mention the little boy s blond hair glowing oh dear 8 laughable editing and continuity where background items move between scenes the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc 9 not got enough money to hire a professional dancer get any lady from off the street to prance about like an idiot no one will notice the difference er 10 a thrilling climax involving quicksand snakes more stuff from the archives and a ton of fake blood don t forget to put in a stupid tribal sounding song either the more sensible among you however will wait for it s inevitable appearance on mst3k when this classic tv show is resurrected and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable not to mention unworkable so don t even try it 0 10,0
i can t believe that the city of muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there this show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law enforcement officers i have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life if they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie i only saw it once and was appalled at what i saw i wanted to see the little guy get into a foot chase with a bad guy what a joke that would have been nothing on the show was even close to the real world the city of muncie the police chief and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city no wonder it didn t stay around on tv,0
there are good bad movies and bad bad movies and enjoyably bad movies this isn t one of them this is a movie that doesn t realize just how bad it is i saw this at a screening on november 14 2006 at the new beverly theater in los angeles as part of the grindhouse cinema this theater puts on every month hopefully presenters eric caiden co will think twice before letting writer director lawrenece foldes anywhere near them again what a con man the guy got up to speak before the film you would think he was orson welles talking about touch of evil or some other lost classic hardly nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences time with his incoherent rambling young warriors has been described as a cross between animal house and death wish but if you are expecting something along the lines of imitations like revenge of the nerds or the exterminator you will be in for one sad disappointment the script makes zero sense the direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up poor richard shaft roundtree in this movie he plays another character with the first name of john but that s about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic i hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included ernest borgnine and linda day george this is a complete waste of time even the audience did not seem that into it except for the one spazz boy sitting in the back who yelled whoa every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized talking barbie every time he opened his mouth for real films about vigilantes i would suggest the following death wish i ii iii exterminator i vigilante force ms 45 rolling thunder the no mercy man the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago probably the same budget as young warriors but both were a million times better :D,0
given christopher nolan s string of successful films it s a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature which is shot in black and white back in england running less than 70 minutes long done with little budget but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller though short the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing because the premise doesn t even scratch the surface of this tale which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative s structure and characterization as told we follow a writer wannabe called bill jeremy theobald who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner which at first could be conceived as research before he starts to make up his own rules and break them he meets up with charismatic cobb alex haw who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victim s livelihood as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond lucy russell a mobster s moll who rejects his every advance told in a non linear fashion which comes with scenes that don t quite add up in the beginning this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more which gets duly delivered there are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo where loose ends begin to come together and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through it s also amazing how as a first feature shot on the cheap that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being burgled with nolan involved in every stage of production from writing to shooting producing and directing having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends i guess here s an example of a successful filmmaker s humble roots which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there now i ll patiently wait for christopher nolan s inception due out later this year whose trailer is already such a tease ,1
this movie was good i can t say it was one of the best but it still was good the only reason that i watched it was because of ryan phillippe he is soo hot don t get mad reese but i think that it was sort of funny not a laugh your head out kinda thing but still o k ,1
greetings from lithuania this is the first question that comes to head after watching this movie you know i saw a lot of bad movies in my life but after watching this one i only had two questions 1 is this was just a parody spoof 2 how could people create such a thing if you never saw this film than you really don t know what is a really bad film i mean bad the script are you kidding my acting is so horrible that i thing the actors where just having fun in this movie i know this is b movie but come on is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage oh and what an ending a must miss ending just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw wait until the ending because that kind of ending you have never saw before and i hope you will never see awoid this movie at any cost and don t say i didn t warn you ,0
i am a great fan of martin amis on whose book this film is based unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development it is an hilarious examination of human greed excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel in his hands the film screams along at breakneck speed indulging in every known trick shot and odd camera angle possible it is like ken russel on acid and suffers from that older director s self indulgence cranked up to a hundred not even the brief glimpse of gorgeous actor christian solimeno s penis was enough to save this wretched film for me abysmal ,0
to be honest this film is another in a series of huge disappointments most of these so called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub par effects and laughable story lines aside from ron perlman everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop it under the boom mike or something and looked completely unrealistic overall this film is about as scary as home alone the only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe pelts i don t know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand ,0
this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man turned flying demon is let loose on the world the cgi is par for a tv job and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as appleby s mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign also the scenes where burgi is training appleby for battle are actually laughable they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably remo williams ,0
 the running jumping standing still film is not a film as such but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme this film got richard lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first beatles film a hard day s night richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 this film was entitled the running jumping standing still film it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone a small amount of money and time was invested the sole purpose of this film is entertainment but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera the film cost 70 to make and it was filmed in sepia toned film stock in a field on a couple of sundays all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production the finished production is eleven minutes in length the running jumping standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time all of the events in this film take place in a field a few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record a photographer developing film in a pond an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model s face a man building a tent an athlete running over the tent and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away but it also pokes fun at english culture when compared to american culture another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom one of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it and the kite breaks according to neil sinyard author of the films of richard lester this event symbolizes the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age according to this scene the british fly primitive kites while the americans the world power after world war ii fly highly advanced rockets and space shuttles ,0
as a former erasmus student i enjoyed this film very much it was so realistic and funny it really picked up the spirit that exists among erasmus students i hope many other students will follow this experience too however i wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience but at least one of my friends who has never gone on erasmus also enjoyed it very much i give it 9 out of 10 ,1
christopher guest is the master of the mockumentary werner herzog is one of many documentary greats out there zak penn isn t good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films sort of an essential with a mockumentary penn could also take a lesson from the the blair witch project even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created it seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know deep down you re watching fiction in other words it was fiction successfully disguised as truth in fact many early audiences watching it at sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real penn whose forte by his own admission is screen writing should probably stick to that documentary or mockumentary film making and it s hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film is obviously not penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary sort of a meta documentary penn however confuses the audience and loses their trust from the get go as he enters herzog s house before the filming of herzog s film enigma of loch ness about the myth of the loch ness monster a film which apparently was never finished probably because of penn s interference even though penn is apparently the director of the film we re watching he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying what is the film crew doing here and starts shying away from them he does this on a couple other occasions as well he will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between herzog and penn it seems to be a gimmick but that is never made clear and penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally this leaves the audience scratching its head wondering who is in charge here if penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of this is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world i think when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the loch ness monster but by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally exited the fictional world penn has attempted to create so it all just seems silly and pointless this is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary penn s presence begins to pervade and overshadow everything else in the movie the herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isn t acting we even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being duped by penn much the way the audience is but you re never sure of even that penn in his interviews to the camera attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny like the characters interviewed in a guest mockumentary but he only succeeds in being annoying in a guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because you re never sure what penn is about as a result we the audience start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance out of nowhere of a beautiful model thrown in to give the movie spice there is little to recommend here perhaps its only redeeming quality an unintentional one at that is that it s a great example of why the audience is important and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a disservice for that reason alone i think this would be a good film to show to film students sort of a what not to do kind of movie i have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long it s done skillfully with a thematic base to give it substance this film is completely lacking in that i d like to call it a valiant effort at something but i m not sure what it is other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time as a side note it seems like bad art always calls to mind good this film made me think of the book picture by lillian ross ross followed john huston around during the filming of the red badge of courage and brilliantly documented it for the new yorker it would make a great movie in fact if you want a great example of meta art read it ,0
 in the tradition of carrie and heathers try a shameless ripoff of not only those two films but the evil dead and the shining as well that said they really don t make bad horror movies like this anymore and that s a shame cause it s a gas rainbow harvest is the winona substitute here and although she barely does more than mumble her lines and occasionally scream you re ugly into her haunted mirror she s goth way before it s fashionable so you have to respect her and she s quite creative about it too accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black spray painted hawaiian punch guy hat eat your heart out cher karen black overacts a bit but she s not totally without dignity and you can t help but sympathize with her unless you re a certain friend of mine who asked who is that horse lips from m a s h the first time she came onscreen there are decent supporting performances by kristin dattilo as the square chick who befriends rainbow ricky paull goldin in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role and william larry darryl and darryl sanderson as some kind of pet undertaker or something but it s sad to see the once smokin yvonne decarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the charlotte rae part the eighties were the heyday for hilarious mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this and mirror mirror was one of the last of its kind definitely worth a look ,0
great actors good filming a potentially interesting plot and what should have been good dialog nothing else is good about this movie perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee within 10 minutes i disliked the portrayal of kim by caroleen feeney so much that it became a distraction while kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character i am not sure i was supposed to want to commit acts of physical violence upon her the first of many bizarre things that happen is that wes david strathairn goes from i am missing 50 00 to she stole 50 in about 3 seconds it was quite implausible since she kim never had access to his wallet nor was she a master pickpocket there simply was no rational reason to suspect her most people have lost misplaced money and assume just that we lost it same goes for kim later all very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be i think a look at real people the character of kim was at minimum suffering from a bipolar disorder wes had huge inadequacy issues nancy was just boring and matt was delusional particularly about music i actually turned this off about 2 3 of the way through however to write a valid comment i forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie no sorry it was still bad make it a point to miss this one ,0
why has this not been released i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn t been how wrong can a girl be this film is in a word enthralling you will be captivated it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows the final part of the film the episode as it were not giving anything away you saw that in the trailer is also unmissable you will chose a favourite you will be shocked you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch cudos to the actors it s very believable and it doesn t stop there they have a final shock for you it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really endemol who make big brother made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman s kidney to patients in need of a transplant the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation but are we getting too close for comfort ,1
if you want your vision of chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your belly laughs from pathos watch something else if however you love slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best do watch this one the image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl he spots another couple kissing on a park bench and he has a blast ruining their fun this is one of chaplin s park comedies filmed in mack sennett s park with pickpockets and cops and couples these shorts work as the format allows chaplin to shine as he weaves through predicaments i checked the box as this could be considered a spoiler though it s not if you ve seen these films everyone ends up in the pond except chaplin he gets the girl who in this case was played by minta durfee a k a mrs roscoe fatty arbuckle ,1
i don t remember barnaby jones being no more than a very bland standard detective show in which as per any quinn martin show act i was the murder act ii was the lead character figuring out the murder act iii was the plot twist another character murdered act iv was the resolution and the epilogue was betty lee meriwether asking her father in law barnaby jones buddy ebsen how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show one thing i do remember was the late great composer jerry goldsmith s excellent theme song strangely the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air i will also admit that it was nice to see ebsen in a role other than jed clampett despite ebsen being badly miscast i just wished the show was more entertaining than when i first remembered it update 1 11 2009 i watched an interview with composer jerry goldsmith on youtube through their archive of american television channel let s just say that i was more kind than goldsmith about the show barnaby jones ,0
a precursor to citizen kane in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks in spencer tracy s 15th film he already looks middle aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young a little silent screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable well written drama ,1
like several other reviewers here i m surprised to see many negative reviews on this film dan o bannon s previous effort was the groundbreaking alien of 1979 because it and star wars introduced the stylistic approach of used or dirty space in art direction for these kinds of features doesn t mean that this was the only way to produce them rather than dismiss lifeforce out of hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature it s important to recognize that the film draws upon the esteemed traditions of british horror and science fiction specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass specifically quatermass and the pit 1967 doctor who and the day of the triffids 1963 if not the works of gerry anderson ufo space 1999 and thunderbirds but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer o bannon s genre scholarly appreciation for queen of blood 1966 and it the terror from beyond space 1958 the immediate sources for alien 1979 granted this film has some legacy elements but perhaps it s worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers 1981 s an american werewolf in london and the company of wolves 1984 other 80 s films that share a looking back while they adapt those stories to the 80 s zeitgeist all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same but substantially sexed up their themes because they could and at the same time they recognized the tongue in cheek humorous aspects of their projects neil jordan s wolves played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the 80 s while american werewolf curdled its theme as a coming of age film it s called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter day dramedy inherent in the scream franchise i know what you did last summer and final destination but these teen targeted films seem to be part of a box office trend whereas the 80 s films like lifeforce belong a canon of british sci fi even if this one was written by an american in many ways this film holds up much better than latter day disaster and alien invasion flicks independence day armageddon deep impact in that the solutions don t reside in gun battles weaponized payloads and testosterone at the opposite end of the pole it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn t examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade solaris the goal of this film was fun not ponderousness or stupidity 7 10,1
i saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating the conflict between the public and private faces of williams and the pressure he was under is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised the cast acted superbly but michael sheen was outstanding i only realised it was him when i saw the earlier comment he looks completely physically different in this role from any other role i have seen him in or as himself williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries as represented in this film the film is at times distressing to watch because of the emotional anguish displayed however it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly ,1
i have to say i totally loved the movie it had it s funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because it s something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting name calling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldn t really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it,1
you may not believe this but when the credits to this movie rolled i looked for the director s name when i saw it i burned it into my memory and i never forgot it this movie is beyond terrible it makes ed wood s films look like orsen welles at least b movies are entertaining this was a soul deadening experience the quality was so bad i began to wonder who allowed this to happen i hear uwe boll runs fourteen miles a day this is because wherever his movies are viewed the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork the script was terrible the lighting was like that of a high school football game and the cinematography was just above the quality of roger patterson s bigfoot video the acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility in the end was a film alan smithee wouldn t have put his name on i learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances from what i hear this is not a bad thing to do ,0
what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight or gay man working in a gay sexual environment the dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component they may not all be prostitutes for hire but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the dancers for private sessions even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the dancers only playing to the women in the audience this just isn t the reality of these clubs it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples so what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients we learn very little instead we get filler a gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers lives and attitudes the pictures of mexico city are generic the phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men ,0
funny sad charming these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful simple film it is rare that a movie truly moves me but shall we dance accomplished that with grace to spare gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history it left me with a quiet sense of exultation but with a small touch of sadness mixed in and the dancing oh yes the dancing even if you are not a lover of the art or can t put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can it was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show sugiyama s touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous child like way and yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast beauty pain emotion all the love and little agonies of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture ,1
who gave these people money to make a movie there was nothing funny about it the fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing about this piece of sickness says it all first of all it has nothing to do with christmas it just took the name and counted on all those people who liked the chevy chase original they took randy i have no talent i m just a fat and sweaty pig quaid the only wrong thing about part 1 and made a movie about him there are only morons in his family but not the aren t they cute kinda moronic but the don t touch me kinda moronic watching this pile of dirt helps you hope that everyone who takes part in it dies they didn t even bother to get the effects in order when they re on the boat the only thing that moves is the fake background when pigface quaid is in the water you can tell by the lighting that it s in a studio this movie was sexist uncle nick racist uncle nick and should never have been made never throwing the money into a volcano would have had so much more use well i hope i reached some of you nobody warned me and now i m scarred for life merry f cking christmas,0
i ll start with what i liked i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good choreography everything i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene but that s about it i get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way 3 stars for the songs :),0
the first time i ve seen this dvd i was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything but also because the dvd itself is extremely loud jimmy page obviously can t live with quiet music i guess i do must say though that during the concert at royal albert hall they expanded how many more times and moby dick too long other than that it was exquisit my favorite song of all time is now on that dvd trampled underfoot it s either that one or in my time of dying in that song jimmy really plays that thing good ever seen randy rhoads play well jimmy plays just like him except his guitar is lower ,1
i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts and to be honest i didn t know how much i would like it i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly he s definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was evie s rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs in my opinion watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable i strongly disagree with,1
nothing is worse than the genocides of our world s history this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family a common narrative device in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war the story however becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives in other words if you don t really care about them the film grows boring it s hard not to care though when a family s homeland is wrecked i m not sure if i would recommend this film because it says very little politically and honestly did not keep my interest in the family s troubles ,1
when i borrowed this movie from a friend thankfully i did not buy it on the package which truly looked bad and ugly was printed the ultimate vampire horror after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself the story begins when a teenager surprise is chased by some vampire zombie creatures lighting sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video on a ten year old vhs system if not worse i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promo t shirts looked kind of cool i don t want to dis film students or splatter movies generally but i ve seen braindead and i ve seen a 20 dollar budget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap ,0
oh it s an excellent piece of work to be sure in fact several of the best scenes in cinema or at least in bergman s cinema are to be found in this film liv ullmann and max von sydow are as good as you would expect do these two give bad performances sven nykvist delivers some masterful although unconventionally masterful cinematography the script is quite good especially in individual scenes sometimes the film lags and the pace is uneven though probably intentionally so what s the problem well the film is too bleak for its own good other bergman films are similarly bleak but nowhere near this harsh eventually i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated i was greatly affected often during the film but by the end i felt uninvolved it s a great film but i doubt i d ever watch it again nor suggest it to friends or if i did suggest it i d be very sure to warn them of what s ahead 8 10 ,1
jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous therefore it doesn t really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away drew barrymore fresh off her acclaimed role as poison ivy must have done this film simply as a favor to director phedon papamichael he was the cinematographer on ivy playing a character named daisy drew she s bumped off right away which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff fahey and sean young who hasn t had a single subtle moment on camera since blade runner this witless script by michael angeli concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife s face from a murder witness s testimony and while that s not a bad idea for a plot it would be much better suited to an hour long tv series this cable made movie is short on inspiration beginning with the casting and shorter on surprises from ,0
hmmmmmmm cheerleader massacre let me think high school girls get sliced up except the cute one survives got it next movie i was actually surprised this one was made in 2003 i really thought they quit making these movies in the 80 s this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy dumb male horn dogs even dumber male adult and hot teacher it continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods we have seen it all before however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me too slashers so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill you could do worse ,0
i loved this film not being a swooning ed wood jr fan i prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings his movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as ed s we get insight into ed s personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool this ability to define a person s legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood s legend in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling ,1
after citizen kane in 1941 hollywood executives turned their cob webbed backs on the great orson welles with the exception of kane welles lost all creative control on magnificent ambersons journey into fear and many other films to come welles was an innovative and creative genius the most unconventional of filmmakers when hollywood was in need of a few more the lady from shanghai is yet another example of the misunderstood view of welles films at the time a movie that seems a bit choppy and non fluent it has a conventional 1940 s premise told in a most unconventional way and i am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor it is now legend that columbia mogul harry cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about in hindsight many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story telling of orson welles and the lady from shanghai is only nearly great because of their intrusion beside being arguably the greatest director of all time welles was also quite a performer as an actor at 25 we all know what he did as charles foster kane perhaps the most famous character in film history here he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence something unfamiliar to those familiar with welles other great work instead of a slick wise tongue he speaks with a rough irish twang rita hayworth his unhappily married wife at the time plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment he is a large lug who may have even murdered a man but the real mystery lies in the relationship between hayworth with stunning blonde hair and crippled hubby everett sloane mr bernstein from citizen kane a creepy partner of sloane s is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has welles michael o hara head spinning welles narrates the picture as o hara but things are still unclear throughout see for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what s up an uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around o hara with sloane defending him it is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods including sloane cross examining himself i didn t really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway up to this point the cinematography is great some scenes are shot with craft and skill aquarium love scene but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us the audience in reportedly the court scene was re shot against welles requests 10 closeups of hayworth were ordered and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at cohn s insistence a gaudy score infuriated welles who once again was left out of the editing process thank welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour de force ending that will always be treasured the so called hall of mirrors scene brings buffs back time and time again rightfully so it must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented the crash of the mirrors represents o hara s disillusionment and the crazy house itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration it seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed crazy twisted and turned like a dali painting this is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the afi s top 100 then again 3 or 4 more of orson welles films may have made all collective best of lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic note look for the mercury players that are so prominent in welles pictures they pop up all over rating 8 of 10,1
the girl in lovers lane 3 out of 10 homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as top gun and spartacus the girl in lover s lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope in fact it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k whom rarely notes such things in their riffing simply cannot avoid it the film is about two drifters one a rich kid lowell brown running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts the other is a professional hobo brett halsey the hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner a pool hall and a whorehouse our drifter scholar gets a second look from the diner s waitress joyce meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane who clearly is past the age of being choosy and whose only other prospect is creepy jack elam doing a steve buscemi impression on the surface this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing the acting is actually pretty good with both brett halsey and jack elam giving solid performances the story is slight but hardly the robot vs aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot but relatively competent it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious halsey s over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious his inability to commit to the waitress or at the least get past first base are telling and the dozens of glances between him and the kid a hand on shoulder the sleeping arrangements blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other you don t have to be freud to figure out this undercurrent ,0
this is not a children s movie this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of 5 for a month my 4 year old from time to time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits and that wasn t the worst of it we stopped it about a 1 2 hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately he s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges go ahead censure me my conscience is clear ,0
perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia s comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren t laughing if there s anybody who s insecure it s a comedian who won t shut up about his audience then again perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia s comedy is that he doesn t get off his free speech high horse if you want to be funny just make a joke don t explain all the reasons why you re saving the american way with your failed attempts at generating laughter hmm actually the worst thing about carlos mencia s comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor avoid this like the plague ,0
one of disney s best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty two minutes and after all wasn t movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight magictrain,1
when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow 1 the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens what who how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst 2 the van will break down 3 whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about 4 they will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them 5 the house will have a phone but it will not work it will be disturbingly decorated there will be flickering neon light spiders and maggots 6 the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won t start here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor 7 the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly 8 only a girl will be left alive from the group 9 there will be an unnecessary twist at the end add to these elements naked sirens who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film darkhunters which is one of the worst films i have ever seen at times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity however the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the dvd extras if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director s commentary it is beyond belief there is more to say about this than the film itself one staggering part of the commentary is the director s claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if people will get it i m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question what was the point this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different haven t worked the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use however the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant the best moment is reserved for robert s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who didn t like it are generalised as geeks and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn t singled out for ridicule the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers complete with hilarious accents to imply that people from norway wouldn t know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast robert s swears blind in voice over i didn t want to make a film that was like baywatch as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground there is also a simpering self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i don t know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track robert s says jokingly i can see people sitting at home saying this isn t amazing its sh t he isn t wrong ,0
this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick the story revolves around sammy horn subtle name played by michael des barres sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace rosanna arquette and a young child he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist nastassja kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts which consumes at least 75 of the screen time it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad the production values are abysmal the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someone s garage the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting uninspired framing and poor actor direction the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation as an example grace s sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows he s been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her oh great to see you gotta run to pick up timmy and mum s the word about sammy s indiscretions the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it the sex depictions are all overdone mechanical and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic most of them are done with both participants fully clothed the acting is wretched michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski he is adrift rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist but at least we have some acting happening here the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder is that the best you can do and oh god yes this movie is among the worst i have ever seen a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1 10 not to be seen within three hours of any meal ,0
i went to see this film out of curiosity and to settle an argument the film is now best known from the suite of music sergei prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film the troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements the general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings a clerk accidentally generates a non existent lieutenant kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar the tsar is interested in this person and rather than tell him he doesn t exist the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real kizhe is exiled to siberia recalled promoted married promoted again dies is given a state funeral revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks i had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented kizhe involving ink blots and sneezes but i d heard the film was lost so there was no way to find out what happens then the film turned up at the barbican in london as part of their prokofiev festival for the record it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns kuzhe into kizhe as the tsar is in a hurry to see the order there s no time to correct the mistake having gone expecting an historical curiosity i was pleasantly surprised the film is very funny and the audience myself included laughed continuously although most of it is filmed straight set mostly in the palace there are a few trick shots where multiple images appear on the screen for instance the tsar s army is represented by a small group repeated across the screen four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison two identical servants scrub the floor one slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was there were two women who might have been the tsar s daughters or a daughter and a servant or something else and very few people were named but all in all an enjoyable film and i m surprised it s not seen more often ,1
for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious finale i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious m a s h goodbye farewell and amen was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself skip this movie i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too gimmicky and dave coulier man that guy hasn t done anything good well ever they shouldn t have used tim meadows he s a great actor but he was too good for the script i thought the movie was pure cheese i would give it a 4 5 10,0
i was recommended this movie by one of my film making friends and was therefore expecting something good sadly i was very disappointed by the first half ah a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their a hole boss how original and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45 odd minutes i d already wasted but all i got was the shock ending the basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say and says whatever it does say hard to tell what that is badly great acting does not save a bad script full of characters i can t care about now maybe if i didn t moonlight in the movie industry i d be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen but as it is my feelings are as summed up above ho hum 2 10 would have been 1 10 if it weren t for the acting and the paper cut scene ,0
one of the greatest lessons i ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way i was working in roger corman s offices like so many other wanabees before and since i was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable hah one afternoon julie corman roger corman s wife and a producer in her own right asked me to load up a tape i m not sure why she wanted to watch it i got the impression it was a student film or a show reel something like that some sort of calling card whatever the reasons she had to see it the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room i was working in and i was the nearest person to the machine i started the tape fade in on screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera behind him screen left was a door that opened into the room against the far wall was a coat rack a second character entered through the door and started talking the first character the guy at the desk turned round to reply this is all one take static camera there are no cuts pans or dolly shots just one locked off camera the second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line julie corman said i ve seen enough and left the room what she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines nope sorry next that s how long you ve got ten seconds cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead i was reminded of that moment while i watched the opening of this piece of crap after an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages a man carrying a gun laughs a jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal god this is boring cut to the interior of the airport two men meet aha something is happening they shake hands cut to a different angle of the two men and the director crosses the line the first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up not crossing the line is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience audiences don t like to be confused mystified baffled puzzled and intrigued yes audiences love all of those confused no you loose them they walk out not crossing the line is one of those things they pound into you at film school or should it s basic stuff it s not an inviolable rule there are no inviolable rules directors break it all the time but not on the first real cut of the movie i thought i ve seen enough and switched off ,0
this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good if eccentric use of the isle of man as a background the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper class english girls and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes the story is altered a little from the traditional version early on it is oddly combined with the plot of king lear and in later stages cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well but does go over the top at times ,1
this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron the acting is second rate poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film and god help gina gershon her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott cashman get s lost in central park really it s not that hard to navigate central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn t save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back ,0
writer director jay andrews a k a jim wynorski serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade z computer generated reptiles in komodo vs cobra as generic a rip off of mysterious island meets jurassic park as you can imagine the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects the cobra and the komodo are hilariously awful however the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims not that any of this is in the least believable clearly komodo vs cobra had a budget that so low that virtually everything non human in its looks as fake as all get out this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the u s military conducts top secret dna testing on animals the result is that gigantic komodos and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise as the action opens the primary scientist is gobbled up by a cobra that likes to swim after we are introduced to a group of greenpeace like environmental protesters and a journalist planet one organizer jerry ryan ryan mctavish of hellbent pays charter boat skipper jim stoddard michael pare of cbs tv s houston knights five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island meanwhile the u s military suspect that something is amiss on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the supersized predators our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island dr susan richardson michelle borth of wonderland the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction the title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes who have been consistently whittled down by the monsters find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island there s no tension suspense or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature the best thing about this yawner is composer chuck cirino s orchestral soundtrack it gives komodo vs cobra an epic feel usually jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel but this ranks far below his low standards the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys in one scene our heroic group fords a river and we don t get to see any wet t shirts drat there s nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck i think that the military guys do far too much saluting when they get their heads together to conspire let s hope that michael pare got a good payday out of this garbage the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought it s not so bad it s good it s just bad ,0
the magnetism radiated from elvira drawing her legions of devoted admirers has a primordial quality with her lengthy well toned figure large bust innocuously mischievous attitude and grab bag lexicon of me generation valley slang the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one liners and large chest as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one dimensional romantic yearning boyish sexual craving and the desire for non threateningly lighthearted fun she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons in the end however her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense fortunately i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer best quote bob redding how s your head elvira i haven t had any complaints ,1
i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script jonathan rhys myers misspelled and jewel were outstanding in their support roles as was jeffery wright toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted when he had to amputate his best friend s arm knowing he would die without the procedure attention to detail with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine i have strong suspicions which makes it all the more appealing to me i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents completely overlooked movie rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours then judge ,1
this western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union while nice guy dean jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons so it s up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8 it was that good however for the life of me i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film after all he knew nothing about westerns his forte was drama and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts just set in the old west strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job as for the rest of the film it s exceptional with vivid color great location shooting and very good acting as usual randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance i was surprised though with robert young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decision he was supposed to be a harvard educated easterner when i saw barton maclane was also in the film i pretty much assumed he d be the baddie and my thoughts were well founded since he made a career out of playing jerks as for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i d hoped making this movie ending on a very high note ,1
this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon there s this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it s atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn t bother me so much so that i didn t even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it s miserably forgettable the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja ,0
i m still laughing not i m still asking my myself what the point was i barely got a chuckle this movie sucks it tries to be charming and touching but it turns out stupid i do not recommend it ,0
chris noth plays a maniac who wrote a children s book as a young lad posing as a doctor who menaces a community in order to push his sister s son into the position as his school s genius the only man that can stop him is a cop who plays by his own rules and is forced to go undercover with the help of his mute father who communicates via oujii board will rick springfield find out whats up or will somebody sabotage his recording studio does the mentally retarded boy who operates the book mobile have clues watch to find out i m not making this up ,1
until today i thought there only three people including me who considered heaven s gate 1980 to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western since the 1970 after little big man 1970 jeremiah johnson 1972 the outlaw josey wales 1976 and the long riders 1980 i was stunned and pleased to see that 22 5 of those voting at imdb rate this movie a 10 as do i a recent book the worst movies of all time includes heaven s gate through it s production and release it was vilified as no movie since cleopatra almost twenty years before at one time it was considered the most expensive over budget movie of all time surpassing even cleopatra it was blamed for the downfall of its studio united artists until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling michael cimino fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess but clearly that was petty jealousy at its worst cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the american experience this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking ,1
this was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie except that there was no movie coming up the film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in wwii and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditions this is most certainly not it having said that the acting was great and locations authentic this could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time instead it isn t even mediocre and i cannot recommend it at all ,0
 and if you re very very good it will resemble moon over parador this film had a slightly silly story but it was a fantasy after all and the casting and the acting was spot on dreyfuss was perfect as the actor impostor full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes this was one of dreyfuss s best roles just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator and the parting scene like something out of casablanca indeed raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police he gets some really funny lines some of which are homages to other films like round up the usual suspects and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend in addition to being a really hot number you should get an oscar for tonight let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves sammy davis jr ike pappas dick cavett all perfectly done all in all a memorable romp under the paradorian moon r ,1
this movie is essentially a how to on how to be a well connected pedophile i m amazed that so many people especially other gay men have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if weber was not an influential photographer he would be in jail doing time for child abuse poor peter johnson weber took this poor naive although incredibly handsome teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the midwest brought him to live in his home and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him many of them full frontal nudes all through johnson s teenage years that ain t art it s child abuse and what s worse weber made lots of money off of it and poor johnson is going to have serious issues the rest of his life weber s lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy as are his ramblings about famous and not so famous people he s known as he tries to complete johnson s education creepy and then just plain boring the only redeeming thing i can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self deception but i can t help but wonder why no one ever considered the effect this was having on chop suey weber s nickname for johnson himself ,0
i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so it s hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexander leesville louisiana i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector in fact they double took me a few times so it s hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon cheryl lockett alexanderleesville louisiana,1
though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire its fall in 1453 was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles the us did not merely mimic golden byzantiums public architecture the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great byzantium i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster john romer is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing not recommended for americans who like political correctness ,1
this is a really mediocre film in the vein of buckaroo banzai the cast runs around like mad max wannabes and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience wheeler nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actresses you are delighted to stumble across in films but she isn t worth the price of rental space maggot starts an electrical fire and burns a vote of 4 ,0
outstanding film of 1943 with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943 encounting treachery around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn like shedding of tears when they must part resolute she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to liberty a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe ,1
as far as the movie goes it s an ok science fiction movie it has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes that said it s not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched as for calling this another cube movie is utter and complete bullsh t this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of people androids as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch i gave this a 3 because of the backstabbing of the original this one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all watchable for those who have not seen cube hypercube but not recommendable for fans of the series ,0
this movie is all flash and no soul the actors put a lot of passion into the numbers but these numbers often didn t connect with the film and felt like stand alone music videos and no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you every single one sounds like its coming from a studio essentially sucking all the life from the songs off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized especially hudson who essentially plays the same angry strong she s stubborn and selfish black woman we ve seen before there was absolutely no depth to her character nor any of the other female leads though i think the movie wants us to believe that hudson s character faces hardship because of her weight it is really her own refusal to do what s best for the team that lands her in trouble making the end of the film totally meaningless hudson s academy award is a joke there was no justification when she sang she put forth emotion though it was often misplaced but this was the writer director s fault but when she was just acting she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character eddie murphy s character is the only one with an arc and he did a fine job but still not oscar worthy the only actor who really brought something to the roll was danny glover who took a small relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it there is nothing here to sink your teeth into no drama or heart or even laughs the placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one the number when hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a family guy skit the movie has no idea what it s about and i felt insulted by the last few minutes it s a big boring waste of time and really is the worst film i saw in 06 and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with ,0
this is the first pepe le pew cartoon and in some ways it s very similar to the later ones but in a few other odd ways it is not while the object of pepe s affections is a cat oddly it appears to be a boy cat this whole predicament occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone unfortunately this attracts our hero pepe most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected ending and this actually makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series excellent animation though the style is different than later examples excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this one a keeper ,1
life is crazy you re crazy i m crazy we re all crazy we re all a little bit minnie and a little bit moskowitz sometimes it does seem best to be sensible but then what might you be missing out on you gotta be you you don t have to park cars and semi randomly yell at people but you can t hide yourself behind a veil or dark sunglasses and pretend and act like everything is okay and sometimes you really do have to throw caution to the wind because why else are you alive i m not going to rate this love compared to cassavetes other movies because they are all absolutely 100 unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives in that sense they are all great and comparisons are odious for sure this movie has that one crazy sometimes maddening but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have you never know what s going to happen next and you never know what the characters are going to think do or feel next neither do the characters themselves and do we really want to live our lives any other way unlike moskowitz you can have a great job and judiciously sock away money into your ira but still live the life of an adventurer inside in your feelings your spirit and your very experience of life yeah we can have it both ways that s what cassavetes shows us thank god somebody did ,1
to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story it s set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta young s she s on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husband s plea for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are dominant and they re not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies there are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film mostly from glenda farrell who swigs gin from her hot water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds there s now a law against selling an example of her repartee be careful farrell it s too late to be careful aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but don t expect her to be given a dramatic moment the main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is ,0
the big knife a movie about the dark side of the hollywood motion picture industry is ironically far more like a filmed play than a film itself apart from a few very brief expository scenes all of the action takes place in the living room of the film s hero played by jack palance he s a movie actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they put out his on again off again wife ida lupino is also fed up with the studio not to mention her husband s philandering ways unfortunately for them both the head of the studio rod steiger is a real bastard he has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract but it s only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far this film is not i repeat not a film noir rather it s an exceptionally theatrical sitting room melodrama the plot proceeds at a snail s pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and carefully contrived blocking of the actual scenes the acting is overwrought in the extreme and veers sharply between out and out histrionics and softer but no less unsubtle soliloquies that are obviously meant to be poignant but come across as pretentious twaddle especially in the hands of the woefully miscast palance aldrich was obviously going all out for a stylized something here but i doubt even he knew what it was and certainly the audience never does i think the main lesson here is that films and plays are very different mediums what might have worked in a play did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film the result a big waste of time there s little to enjoy here ,0
i can t believe we don t have that 70 s show anymore i have all 8 seasons of that 70 s show i absolutely love it i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep at the end of a long busy day it s nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep i was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the re runs i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion like maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married wouldn t that be awesome it would be even better if they would continue it for several years ,1
isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation la pianiste truly confirms it as if that wasn t enough annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation so as you may well imagine those pieces of casting are worth the horror we re put through isabelle and annie play characters we ve never seen before on the screen a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath personally i don t believe in the director s intentions i don t believe they the intentions that is go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of girardot s strength i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me you can t afford to miss la pianiste ,1
made with film stock left over from the production of nana 1927 s sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned and that s the best way to view it jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston naturally he assumes she s a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of white aborigine music there are plenty of surreal touches be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hessling s hair the angels the girl telephones renoir and producer pierre braunberger among them or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while hessling s dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion but there s not really enough to sustain it for two reels an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions gate s new dvd ,0
if you love the thin man series you will love this movie powell s character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles there are even dogs the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy but it isn t half bad ,1
want a great recipe for failure take a crappy leftist political plot add in some weak completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known let stew for a week the amount of time probably spent making this trash the result is steal this movie a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived this movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time words cannot convey how painful it was to watch this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of this is not plan 9 from outer space this is a long boring and sad waste of time steal this movie is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen it depresses me when i realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this tripe if you can call it acting but then again when you have poor direction poor writing poor everything acting is the last thing to criticize this movie is like a huge disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers thank you robert greenwald for giving me newfound respect for every other movie i have ever seen you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and or boring ,0
proof why hollywood conventions are in place stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn s bonnie and clyde 1967 and george roy hill s butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn t work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn t needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 s i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60 s through the mid 70 s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me we know from penn s and hill s movies who the heroes are even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away i could care less who was on the screen in this film i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger s life from june 1933 to july 1934 his death to be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn t seem to try to copy other filmmakers dillinger 1973 isn t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy ,0
although i had previously watched this one some time ago on italian tv i found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time round buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces including a bemused joseph cotten as the baron and contrary to many another film of the euro cult sub genre an incident packed plot in place of lethargic pacing the creature itself looks a bit dodgy and cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still dabbling in creating life forms out of corpses one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at perfecting his technique still but ms neri does look good in and out of costume and reliable herbert fux probably comes off best as a lecherous grave robber blackmailer ,0
anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the 60s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like cannibal girls and sugar hill dillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career the 109 minute dillinger epic for aip s scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 dillinger is basically a chase film with purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967 s bonnie and clyde but we simply don t get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them warren oates s performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it s really too bad that milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent as a piece of 1970s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm s dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out out of 4roving reviewer www geocities com paul_johnr,0
bad news for anyone wanting to film a full length parody of a lifetime network movie the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it albeit unintentionally all of the lifetime tropes are there a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker an unreliable ex husband who of course cheated on her while they were married and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints forcing her to stand up for herself especially jaw dropping is the scene where the heroine after enduring a break in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker decides to relieve the stress by going shopping having seen first hand the harassment of a co worker by some creep she met at church i know stalking is not a joke but it certainly is in this movie ,0
yesterday i finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie my knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase as i saw the movie those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing with some apparently inexplicable details but in the end everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck sorte nula in portuguese above everything i felt that the story made sense and everything fits in it s place properties of a good script i must also mention the soundtrack which helps the creation of an amazing environment and if you think of the resources fernando fragata used to make this film i believe it will make many hollywood producers envious ,1
i had no idea who bruce haack was before seeing this film i had just seen the moog doc which was alright the only problem was moog led a very content life and the doc was well content haack s story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days but it carries a great deal of heart with it though the film doesn t go into the tragic stuff so much one can sense that bruce accepted the price of making music his way there are so many elements that make up his legacy ie invention of the peopleodian where bruce could actually play music by touching people it must have been challenging to document haack s scatter brained output which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable even rap music but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit and the cast what a group of characters bruce surrounded himself with but what do you expect from a telepathic guru tripping with kids fighting against the music industry i recommend this film to anyone interested in music history it s that mainstream but that important ,1
frantic somewhat mean spirited infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale it is not outrageous enough to appeal to the will ferrell crowd and not interesting enough to carry the feature length the most i can praise son in law would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor the main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth and pauly shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero there are a few amusing bits involving farm animals and that s about it the story what there is is so simplistic and predictable it makes jury duty seem like gone with the wind merk,0
i love kristen dunst especially in elizabethtown i guess she s the kind of actress who had better not act before camera but just be herself she did that and she looked so natural in elizabethtown in this movie however she did try to add in more artificial performance especially in the first half of the film so that she looked more like a sober editor while in the other half she totally set herself back in her daily track and i just couldn t tell her to be an editor any way therefore her performance is not enduring in this film the film on the whole is attracting and inspiring the character of young is full and reasonable anyway the film tells a big and sophisticated story the only big defect is that it didn t show a turning point of the hero and heroine s love story i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story because that is rather unclear for the two persons ,1
two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor although they share the most screen time together they do not reach their expected performances such films like analyse this meet the parents dr doolittle and nutty professor the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing it feels like especially de niro doesn t enjoy being in showtime thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think unfortunately if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie well i don t think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and murpy again out of ,0
christophe lambert once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money when i see his latest releases i can believe that beowulf is all in all in the good part of the crap movies there are some good thrill scenes indeed the actors themselves aren t too bad but the plot is silly the mortal kombat like music has nothing to do here the ending is really s y really the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was i even wish i wasted my money on something else ,0
there s some very clever humour in this film which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors however after a while it just seems an exercise in style notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier and very good acting by all involved and i was wondering why blier made this film all is revealed in the ending when blier directing claude brasseur gets a phone call from his dad bernard blier from heaven and gets the chance to say how much he misses him an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt but there isn t really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it s entire running time some really nice scenes and sequences however and anyone who likes these mosntres sacrés of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film ,1
for the uninitiated almost any andy milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that i ve seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddiness this is of course milligan s take on the sweeney todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headache inducing camera work grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for there s not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title the best indication of subversive film making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim s tit so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it s definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the foolhardy morbidly curious 3 out of 10 ,0
this film recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 palm springs international film festival is inspiring and moving a famous conductor forced to retire by illness returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music drawing on sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small swedish village this film develops each of its characters well superbly directed acted and sung it brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all hopefully it will find distribution in the united states if you can see it ,1
a young girl surviving as a prostitute a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score they meet each other in thailand you may think by the opening titles it s going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life this film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images but still refreshing this story is also about eros and thanatos it s not an original joke but it is well told says a character and that also applies to this one we ve seen the story but this way we see it thailand appears in hot tones the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place and it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons there is also a good use of the music to dot the actions ,1
this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected of course it s sappy of course it s predictable we all know the fairytale but knowing that when you go to watch it it s enjoyable enough to watch it was funny and sweet i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn t wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t shirts about math i was an outcast in high school and i didn t do these things it goes much deeper than that having to do with many things some of that being how much money your family has how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids anyway i won t get into it i don t agree with other opinions that drew isn t convincing as a geek with braces no make up and unwashed hair i don t think too many people would be drooling over her and even when she goes back to high school and sheds those things she s still wearing the wrong clothes wrong hair and has the wrong attitude to be considered cool and her other geek friend may be beautiful but it doesn t matter where i come from you can still be an outcast and be beautiful inside and out ,1
from time to time it s very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world and that s what happens in the love light the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter better for her certainly because her career as a film director doesn t impress this german count the film tells the story of dame angela carlotti dame mary pickford a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a picturesque squalor an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by picturesque luxury she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angela s two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead but destiny is even crueller and dame angela meanwhile falls in love with a german and to make things worse she doesn t know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal don t mean ich liebe dich but sink any damn italian boat at sea fortunately for dame angela pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him a not strange fact indeed because it is not an easy task for a german to go unnoticed but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians from that german love a half teutonic baby will born the wicked destiny at full speed but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to extremes a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity but meanwhile dame angela s secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angela s sorrowful life will improve a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind but as they say in germany it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people as this german count said before it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter because as can be seen in the love light she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories ja wohl but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances and now if you ll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress ,0
ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter plan 9 from outerspace dons t stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece he s from england and thoroughly sarcastic it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly done watch it for the script though,0
well here we have yet another role reversal movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal however this one is not in previous reviews i think i ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late 80s this is one of them just one of the girls is about a high school kid corey haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader marie nicole eggert obviously he can t keep up the charade for too much longer i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn t even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen nicole eggert are the only ones who d want to watch this if you re looking for a good haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 this is about the point that haim s career tanked ,0
there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film let s just face it though the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate who are not necessarily the best actors in this film i m not saying they re not good actors i m saying they stunk in this film the special effects were decent and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye pleasing but it even has several major flaws for instance right before the ship goes under you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters don t get me wrong i love the story of the real titanic but i find this movie an insult to that story editing was atrocious there s no reason for any film to be over 2 1 2 hours with the exception of maybe a biographical movie and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted and not just the my heart will go on song either there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard that could very well be the highlight of the film as for the mood throughout it was extremely dull i was more relieved than sad when jack died which i know cannot be what the director intended in a nut shell i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over hyped chick flick ,0
